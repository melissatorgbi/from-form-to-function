Step by step explanation:
1. The premise states that achieving a ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will require long negotiation.
2. The hypothesis suggests that there will be peaceful negotiation of a ceasefire.
3. The hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise, as it does not explicitly state that the negotiation will be quick or easy. It also does not necessarily entail the premise, as it does not specify whether the negotiation will lead to lasting peace. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral (1).","o does not necessarily entail the premise, as it does not specify whether the negotiation will lead to lasting peace. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral (1).",False,True,False,1
