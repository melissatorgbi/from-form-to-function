2. The hypothesis states ""He was not afraid that he had come to the wrong planet"", suggesting that the person was not afraid of being on the wrong planet.
3. Since the hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise but rather presents a different perspective on the person's feelings, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is neutral.","3.
