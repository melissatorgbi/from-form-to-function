conative,partial,Phil nibbled at the cake.,Phil ate some cake.,0,"Step 1: Identify the key elements in the premise and hypothesis.
- Premise: Phil nibbled at the cake.
- Hypothesis: Phil ate some cake.

Step 2: Analyze the meaning of the words in the premise and hypothesis.
- ""Nibbled"" suggests eating in small bites or taking small bites.
- ""Ate"" suggests consuming food completely.

Step 3: Determine the relationship between the premise and hypothesis.
- The premise ""Phil nibbled at the cake"" does not necessarily imply that Phil ate all or even some of the cake. Nibbling could mean taking small bites without consuming the entire cake.
- Therefore, the hypothesis ""Phil ate some cake"" is not necessarily true based on the premise.

Step 4: Choose the numerical code that reflects the relationship between the premise and hypothesis.

conative,partial,"He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.",He didn't realize how hungry he was for food.,1,"Step by step explanation:
1. The premise states that ""He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously."" This implies that the person in the premise was indeed hungry and ate the food eagerly.
2. The hypothesis states ""He didn't realize how hungry he was for food."" This suggests that the person in the hypothesis was also hungry but did not realize it.
3. Considering the premise and hypothesis together, there is no direct contradiction between them. The premise does not explicitly state that the person did or did not realize how hungry they were, so it is possible that the person in the hypothesis did not realize their hunger despite eating ravenously.
4. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is neutral (1) because the hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise.

Step by step explanation:
1. Analyze the premise: ""He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously."" This sentence describes a sequence of actions where the person starts by nibbling at the filet and then eats ravenously.
2. Analyze the hypothesis: ""He took big bites of the filet, then slowed down."" This sentence also describes a sequence of actions where the person starts by taking big bites of the filet and then slows down.
3. Compare the premise and hypothesis: While the actions described in the premise and hypothesis are similar (both involve eating the filet and then changing the pace), there is no direct contradiction or entailment between them. The hypothesis could be true given the premise, but it is not necessarily implied by it. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is neutral.",,,,,1
conative,partial,"He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.","He ate ravenously, after small bites of the filet.",0,"To determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we need to analyze the meaning of the sentences. 

1. The premise states that ""He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously."" This implies that the person first took small bites of the filet and then ate quickly and eagerly.

2. The hypothesis states that ""He ate ravenously, after small bites of the filet."" This suggests that the person first took small bites of the filet and then ate quickly and eagerly.

Based on the similarity in meaning between the premise and the hypothesis, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is true given the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is entailment.

Therefore, the numerical code for the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is 0 - entailment.","Therefore, the numerical code for the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is 0 - entailment.",True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.","She had worn lipstick that day, not knowing she would be kissed.",1,"To determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we need to analyze the information provided in both sentences.

1. Premise: ""He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.""
- This sentence describes a sequence of events where the man kissed the woman and then noticed the lipstick she had left behind. This implies that the woman was wearing lipstick when she was kissed.

2. Hypothesis: ""She had worn lipstick that day, not knowing she would be kissed.""
- This sentence suggests that the woman was wearing lipstick on the day she was kissed, but she was not aware that she would be kissed.

Based on the information provided in the premise and the hypothesis, we can see that the hypothesis is consistent with the premise. The premise explicitly states that the woman had lipstick on when she was kissed, which aligns with the hypothesis that she had worn lipstick that day. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is entailment.

Therefore, the numerical code for the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is 0 - entailment.","Therefore, the numerical code for the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is 0 - entailment.",True,False,False,0

1. The premise states that ""He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind."" This implies that the man did kiss the woman and noticed the lipstick she had left behind.

2. The hypothesis states that ""He didn't touch her because of the lipstick she had that would smear on him."" This implies that the man did not touch the woman because he was concerned about the lipstick smearing on him.

Based on the information provided in the premise and the hypothesis, we can see that the hypothesis contradicts the premise. The premise indicates that the man did kiss the woman, while the hypothesis suggests that he did not touch her. Therefore, the correct numerical code for the inference relation between the premise and the hypothesis is:

conative,partial,"He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.","He wiped at the lipstick he knew she had left behind, after he had kissed her in return.",0,"To determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we need to analyze the meaning of the sentences and see if one necessarily follows from the other.

1. The premise states that ""He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind."" This implies that after kissing her, he noticed the lipstick she had left behind and brushed at it.

2. The hypothesis states that ""He wiped at the lipstick he knew she had left behind, after he had kissed her in return."" This also implies that after kissing her, he noticed the lipstick she had left behind and wiped at it.

Based on the analysis, the hypothesis is essentially restating the actions described in the premise in a slightly different order. Therefore, the hypothesis must be true given the premise, as it does not contradict or go against any information provided.

Step by step explanation:
1. The premise describes a person studying another person's face and brushing at the hair that is tumbling over her shoulders.
2. The hypothesis states that the person being studied has long hair past her shoulders that the other person moved away.
3. There is no explicit contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis, as the premise does not specify the length of the person's hair, only that it is tumbling over her shoulders.
4. However, there is also not enough information in the premise to definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true, as the length of the person's hair is not explicitly stated.

intransitive-motion,schematic,I RAN around the track.,I walked around the track.,2,"Step 1: Identify the key verbs in the premise and hypothesis.
- Premise: ""ran""
- Hypothesis: ""walked""

Step 2: Determine the relationship between the verbs in terms of intensity or specificity.
- Running is typically faster and more intense than walking. Therefore, running entails walking, but walking does not entail running.

Step 3: Consider the context and common knowledge.
- In the context of physical activity around a track, it is common for people to run rather than walk for exercise or competition.

Step 4: Analyze the inference relation options.
- Entailment (0): The hypothesis ""I walked around the track"" must be true given the premise ""I ran around the track"" because running entails walking.
- Neutral (1): The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise, as there could be other reasons for walking around the track.
- Contradiction (2): The hypothesis ""I walked around the track"" must not be true given the premise ""I ran around the track"" because running and walking are contradictory actions.

1. The premise states that the Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.
2. The hypothesis states that the Chinese have the largest, juiciest apples on the market.
3. There is no direct contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis, as both statements can potentially coexist (the Chinese could have flooded the market with juice-grade apples and still have the largest, juiciest apples).
4. However, the hypothesis goes beyond what is stated in the premise, as it claims that the Chinese have the largest, juiciest apples on the market, which is not explicitly mentioned in the premise.

- The hypothesis states that ""he"" has a very annoying voice. This is a statement about a specific characteristic of ""he.""

Step 2: Compare the premise and hypothesis.
- There is no direct contradiction between the premise and hypothesis. The premise does not explicitly state anything about ""his"" voice being annoying or not.
- The hypothesis does not necessarily entail the premise. Just because ""he"" has an annoying voice does not automatically mean that the presence of ""he"" will make ""I"" more miserable.
- The hypothesis is not neutral either, as it does not directly relate to the cause-effect relationship described in the premise.

Step 3: Determine the inference relation.
- The correct numerical code is 1 – neutral. The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise, as there is no direct contradiction or entailment between the two statements.","- The correct numerical code is 1 – neutral.

comparative-correlative,partial,"The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.","If he is around longer today, I will probably not enjoy myself.",0,"Step by step explanation:
1. The premise states that the longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.
2. The hypothesis states that if he is around longer today, I will probably not enjoy myself.
3. The premise implies that the longer he is around, the worse the situation will be for the speaker.
4. The hypothesis suggests that if he is around longer today, the speaker will probably not enjoy themselves.
5. The hypothesis aligns with the implication of the premise, as both suggest a negative outcome if he is around longer.
6. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is entailment, as the hypothesis must be true given the premise.

comparative-correlative,partial,"The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.",I'm happiest on the days where he is around a lot.,2,"To determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we need to analyze the meaning of the sentences.

1. The premise states that the longer he is around, the more miserable the speaker will be. This implies a negative correlation between his presence and the speaker's happiness.

2. The hypothesis states that the speaker is happiest on the days where he is around a lot. This implies a positive correlation between his presence and the speaker's happiness.

Based on the analysis, the hypothesis contradicts the premise because the premise suggests that the speaker will be more miserable when he is around, while the hypothesis suggests that the speaker is happiest when he is around a lot.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is contradiction.

comparative-correlative,partial,"Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.",We have to do this before the game can start.,0,"To determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we need to analyze the meaning of the sentences. 

1. The premise states that the faster the task is completed, the sooner the game can begin. This implies a causal relationship between completing the task quickly and starting the game sooner.

2. The hypothesis suggests that the task must be completed before the game can start. This implies a temporal relationship where the task completion precedes the start of the game.

Based on the analysis, the hypothesis is not necessarily true given the premise. The premise only states that completing the task quickly will lead to starting the game sooner, but it does not explicitly state that the task must be completed before the game can start. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral.

Therefore, the numerical code for the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is 1 (neutral).","Therefore, the numerical code for the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is 1 (neutral).",False,True,False,1
