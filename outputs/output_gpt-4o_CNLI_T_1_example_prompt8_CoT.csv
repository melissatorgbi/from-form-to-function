let-alone,substantive,"A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.",There will be peaceful negotiation of a ceasefire.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.""
   - This means that achieving a ceasefire will require extensive negotiation, and achieving lasting peace will require even more effort.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""There will be peaceful negotiation of a ceasefire.""
   - This suggests that the negotiation process for a ceasefire will be conducted in a peaceful manner.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise emphasizes the difficulty and length of the negotiation process for a ceasefire and lasting peace.
   - The Hypothesis focuses on the nature of the negotiation process, specifically that it will be peaceful.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not provide information about the nature (peaceful or otherwise) of the negotiation process. It only states that the negotiation will be long.
   - The Hypothesis introduces an additional detail (peaceful negotiation) that is not addressed in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. The Premise does not confirm or deny the peaceful nature of the negotiation.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.",Negotiating lasting peace will take less time than negotiating a ceasefire.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.""
- This statement suggests that achieving a ceasefire will require long negotiations, and achieving lasting peace will require even longer negotiations.

Hypothesis: ""Negotiating lasting peace will take less time than negotiating a ceasefire.""
- This statement suggests that negotiating lasting peace will take less time than negotiating a ceasefire, which is the opposite of what the Premise suggests.

Now, let's compare the two statements:

1. The Premise indicates that negotiating a ceasefire will take a long time, and negotiating lasting peace will take even longer.
2. The Hypothesis suggests the opposite, that negotiating lasting peace will take less time than negotiating a ceasefire.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

The correct numerical value for this relationship is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.","It will take long negotiation to achieve a ceasefire, and even longer negotiation to achieve lasting peace.",0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the statements step by step:

### Premise:
""A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.""

### Hypothesis:
""It will take long negotiation to achieve a ceasefire, and even longer negotiation to achieve lasting peace.""

### Analysis:
1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that achieving a ceasefire will require long negotiation.
   - It further implies that achieving lasting peace will require even more effort (longer negotiation).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that achieving a ceasefire will require long negotiation.
   - It also states that achieving lasting peace will require even longer negotiation.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis agree that a ceasefire will require long negotiation.
   - Both also agree that lasting peace will require even longer negotiation than a ceasefire.

### Conclusion:
- The hypothesis is definitely true given the premise because it restates the same information in a slightly different wording but with the same meaning.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

let-alone,substantive,It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.,Both individuals and society will be consistent after difficulty.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.""

### Hypothesis:
""Both individuals and society will be consistent after difficulty.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that it is challenging for an individual to maintain consistency.
   - It further implies that it is even more challenging for a society to maintain consistency.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis suggests that both individuals and society will achieve consistency after facing difficulty.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise emphasizes the difficulty of achieving consistency for both individuals and society, suggesting that it is a significant challenge.
   - The hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that consistency will be achieved by both individuals and society after overcoming difficulties.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. The premise implies that achieving consistency is very difficult and does not guarantee success, while the hypothesis states that consistency will be achieved after difficulty.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be true given the premise.

### Conclusion:
The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

### Final Output:
2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.,It is easier for a society to be consistent than an individual.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.""
- This statement suggests that it is challenging for an individual to maintain consistency, and it implies that it is even more challenging for a society to do so.

Hypothesis: ""It is easier for a society to be consistent than an individual.""
- This statement suggests the opposite: that it is easier for a society to maintain consistency compared to an individual.

Now, let's compare the two statements:

1. The Premise states that it is difficult for an individual to be consistent and implies that it is even more difficult for a society to be consistent.
2. The Hypothesis states that it is easier for a society to be consistent than an individual.

These two statements are directly contradictory. The Premise implies that societal consistency is more difficult than individual consistency, while the Hypothesis claims the opposite.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.,It is easier for an individual to be consistent than a society.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.""

### Hypothesis:
""It is easier for an individual to be consistent than a society.""

### Analysis:
1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that it is difficult for an individual to be consistent.
   - It further implies that it is even more difficult for a society to be consistent.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that it is easier for an individual to be consistent than a society.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise suggests that both individuals and societies find it difficult to be consistent, with societies finding it even more difficult.
   - The hypothesis directly states that it is easier for an individual to be consistent than a society, which aligns with the implication of the premise.

### Conclusion:
- The hypothesis is directly supported by the premise. The premise implies that consistency is difficult for both individuals and societies, with societies having a harder time. The hypothesis states that it is easier for an individual to be consistent than a society, which is a logical conclusion derived from the premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

let-alone,substantive,"I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.","I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl living in Ohio.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading ""it.""
   - The speaker would be even more distressed to hear of a girl of tender years and experience reading ""it.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The speaker would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading ""it.""
   - The speaker would be even more distressed to hear of a girl living in Ohio reading ""it.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis share the same initial clause: ""I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it.""
   - The difference lies in the specific group of girls mentioned:
     - Premise: ""a girl of your tender years and experience.""
     - Hypothesis: ""a girl living in Ohio.""

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not specify the location of the girl, only her age and experience.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new detail (living in Ohio) that is not mentioned in the Premise.
   - The new detail in the Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise but rather adds additional information that is not addressed in the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis introduces new information that is not covered by the Premise but does not contradict it, the relationship is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.","I would like to hear of ladies reading anything they like, no matter the age of them.",2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.""

- The speaker expresses distress at the idea of any ladies reading ""it.""
- The speaker is even more distressed at the idea of a young, inexperienced girl reading ""it.""

### Hypothesis:
""I would like to hear of ladies reading anything they like, no matter the age of them.""

- The speaker expresses a positive attitude towards ladies reading anything they like.
- The speaker does not care about the age of the ladies reading.

### Analysis:
1. **Sentiment and Attitude**:
   - **Premise**: Negative sentiment towards ladies (especially young girls) reading ""it.""
   - **Hypothesis**: Positive sentiment towards ladies reading anything they like, regardless of age.

2. **Content**:
   - **Premise**: Specific about being distressed by the act of reading ""it.""
   - **Hypothesis**: General approval of reading anything, without specifying ""it.""

3. **Contradiction Check**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis express directly opposing views on the subject of ladies reading.
   - The Premise is distressed by the idea, while the Hypothesis is supportive of it.

Given these points, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because they express contradictory sentiments.

### Conclusion:
The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

### Final Output:

let-alone,substantive,"I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.",I would be distressed to hear of a girl of your tender years and experience reading it.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.""

Hypothesis: ""I would be distressed to hear of a girl of your tender years and experience reading it.""

1. **Identify the key information in the Premise:**
   - The speaker would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading ""it.""
   - The speaker would be even more distressed to hear of a girl of tender years and experience reading ""it.""

2. **Identify the key information in the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker would be distressed to hear of a girl of tender years and experience reading ""it.""

3. **Compare the Hypothesis to the Premise:**
   - The Hypothesis focuses on a specific part of the Premise, namely the distress caused by a girl of tender years and experience reading ""it.""
   - The Premise includes this specific distress and adds that the speaker would be distressed by any ladies reading ""it,"" with an emphasis on greater distress for a girl of tender years and experience.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise. The Premise explicitly states that the speaker would be distressed to hear of a girl of tender years and experience reading ""it,"" which is exactly what the Hypothesis claims.

Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,"None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.",The arguments are not presented in a convincing order.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.""
- This means that the arguments are weak and definitely not conclusive.

Hypothesis: ""The arguments are not presented in a convincing order.""
- This suggests that the arguments are not arranged in a way that makes them persuasive.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

1. **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be entailed by the Premise, the Premise must imply that the arguments are not presented in a convincing order. However, the Premise only states that the arguments are weak and not conclusive. It does not provide information about the order in which the arguments are presented.

2. **Neutral (1)**: The Premise does not give enough information to determine whether the arguments are presented in a convincing order or not. The weakness and inconclusiveness of the arguments do not necessarily imply anything about their order.

3. **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to imply that the arguments are presented in a convincing order. However, the Premise does not address the order of the arguments at all.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relationship is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.",All of the given arguments are strong and conclusive.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.""
   - This means that all the arguments mentioned are weak and not conclusive.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""All of the given arguments are strong and conclusive.""
   - This means that every argument mentioned is strong and conclusive.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that none of the arguments are strong or conclusive.
   - The Hypothesis claims the exact opposite, that all the arguments are strong and conclusive.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise, it cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final output:
2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.",None of these arguments is conclusive.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.""
Hypothesis: ""None of these arguments is conclusive.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The Premise states that none of the arguments are notably strong.
   - Additionally, it emphasizes that none of the arguments are conclusive.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that none of the arguments are conclusive.

3. **Comparing the Premise and the Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that none of the arguments are conclusive.
   - The Hypothesis repeats this specific part of the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is directly stated in the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,"Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.",Ambiguous promises given are not to be happily accepted.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.""
Hypothesis: ""Ambiguous promises given are not to be happily accepted.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The premise states that vague promises do not provide a basis for satisfaction, and even less so for complacency.
   - This implies that vague promises are not sufficient to make someone satisfied or complacent.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis states that ambiguous promises are not to be happily accepted.
   - This implies that ambiguous promises should not be accepted with happiness or satisfaction.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis convey a negative sentiment towards vague or ambiguous promises.
   - The premise explicitly states that vague promises are not grounds for satisfaction, which aligns with the hypothesis stating that ambiguous promises are not to be happily accepted.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the premise's sentiment in a slightly different wording.
   - Since the hypothesis logically follows from the premise and there is no contradiction or uncertainty, the relationship is one of entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,"Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.",The speaker is more complacent than satisfied when hearing vague promises.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.""

### Hypothesis:
""The speaker is more complacent than satisfied when hearing vague promises.""

### Analysis:
1. **Premise Breakdown**:
   - The premise states that vague promises do not provide any grounds for satisfaction.
   - It further emphasizes that they provide even less grounds for complacency.

2. **Hypothesis Breakdown**:
   - The hypothesis suggests that the speaker is more complacent than satisfied when hearing vague promises.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise clearly states that vague promises do not lead to satisfaction or complacency.
   - The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests a comparison between complacency and satisfaction, implying that the speaker feels more complacent than satisfied.

4. **Inference**:
   - The premise indicates that neither satisfaction nor complacency is achieved from vague promises.
   - The hypothesis contradicts this by suggesting a degree of complacency (more than satisfaction), which the premise explicitly denies.

### Conclusion:
The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise because the premise states that vague promises do not lead to complacency at all, while the hypothesis suggests that the speaker feels more complacent than satisfied.

Therefore, the relationship is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.",The promises given are vague and the speaker will not be satisfied nor complacent.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.""
   - This means that the promises are vague and they do not provide a basis for satisfaction, and even less so for complacency.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The promises given are vague and the speaker will not be satisfied nor complacent.""
   - This hypothesis states that the promises are vague and the speaker will neither be satisfied nor complacent.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise states that vague promises are not grounds for satisfaction or complacency.
   - The hypothesis states that the promises are vague and the speaker will not be satisfied or complacent.

4. **Inference**:
   - The hypothesis directly aligns with the premise. The premise implies that the speaker will not be satisfied or complacent due to the vagueness of the promises.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,"Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.",Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to adequately tax the aging population who would be retiring in the near future.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.""

### Hypothesis:
""Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to adequately tax the aging population who would be retiring in the near future.""

### Analysis:
1. **Content Comparison**:
   - The Premise discusses the Government's failure to address current issues and future challenges in a general sense.
   - The Hypothesis specifies a particular issue: the Government's failure to adequately tax the aging population who would be retiring soon.

2. **Specificity**:
   - The Premise is broad and does not mention any specific failures or challenges.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a specific failure related to taxation and the aging population.

3. **Logical Connection**:
   - The Hypothesis could be seen as an example of a failure that fits within the broader category of ""failures of the present"" or ""challenges of the future"" mentioned in the Premise.
   - However, the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the specific claim made in the Hypothesis.

### Conclusion:
Given that the Premise does not provide specific details about the failures or challenges, it is not possible to definitively determine whether the specific claim in the Hypothesis is true or false based on the Premise alone. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as Neutral.

### Final Output:
1",1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.",The Government always owns up to failures committed by them throughout the years and everyone else agrees.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.""
   - This means Mr. Brown believes the Government has not addressed current failures and is even less prepared to handle future challenges.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that ""The Government always owns up to failures committed by them throughout the years and everyone else agrees.""
   - This suggests that the Government consistently acknowledges its failures and that this acknowledgment is universally accepted.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a failure to address current and future issues, implying a lack of acknowledgment or action.
   - The Hypothesis claims the opposite: that the Government always acknowledges its failures and that this acknowledgment is universally accepted.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise suggests a lack of acknowledgment and action, while the Hypothesis suggests consistent acknowledgment and universal agreement.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2

### Premise:
""Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.""

### Hypothesis:
""Mr. Brown stated that the Government is not prepared to face the challenges of the future.""

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - Mr. Brown is making a claim about the Government.
   - He states that the Government has failed to address current issues (""failures of the present"").
   - Additionally, he implies that if the Government cannot handle present issues, it is even less likely to handle future challenges (""let alone the challenges of the future"").

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - Mr. Brown is stating that the Government is not prepared to face future challenges.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise includes a stronger statement: the Government has failed to address current issues and, by extension, is not prepared for future challenges.
   - The Hypothesis focuses only on the Government's lack of preparation for future challenges.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a subset of the information provided in the Premise.
   - If the Government has failed to address current issues, it logically follows that it is not prepared for future challenges.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis is entailed by the Premise.

### Final Output:
0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,There must have been text books around at one time but I can not even identify any titles let alone suppliers.,The speaker does not often read text books if they cannot identify any.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""There must have been text books around at one time but I can not even identify any titles let alone suppliers.""

### Hypothesis:
""The speaker does not often read text books if they cannot identify any.""

### Analysis:
1. **Premise Breakdown**:
   - The speaker acknowledges the existence of textbooks in the past.
   - The speaker admits an inability to identify any titles or suppliers of these textbooks.

2. **Hypothesis Breakdown**:
   - The hypothesis suggests that the speaker does not often read textbooks, inferred from their inability to identify any titles.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Existence of Textbooks**:
   - The premise confirms that textbooks existed at one time.
   - This part of the premise does not directly relate to the hypothesis.

2. **Inability to Identify Titles**:
   - The premise states that the speaker cannot identify any titles or suppliers.
   - This inability could imply a lack of familiarity with textbooks, which might suggest infrequent reading.

3. **Inference of Reading Frequency**:
   - The hypothesis infers that the speaker does not often read textbooks based on their inability to identify any.
   - This inference is plausible but not certain. The speaker's inability to identify titles could be due to other reasons (e.g., poor memory, lack of interest in remembering titles, etc.).

### Conclusion:
- The hypothesis is a reasonable inference but not a definite conclusion from the premise.
- The premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the hypothesis.

### Final Decision:
The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral** because the hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise.

**Relation: 1**",**Relation: 1**,False,True,False,1

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker mentions that there must have been textbooks around at one time.
   - The speaker states that they cannot identify any titles or suppliers of these textbooks.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis claims that the speaker knows a lot about textbooks, including their titles and where they might come from.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise clearly states that the speaker cannot identify any titles or suppliers of textbooks.
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that the speaker knows a lot about textbooks, including their titles and suppliers.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis cannot be true if the premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction.

Final Relation Output: 2",Final Relation Output: 2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,There must have been text books around at one time but I can not even identify any titles let alone suppliers.,"The speaker can deduce textbooks exist, but cannot identify any titles or thier suppliers.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

**Premise:** There must have been text books around at one time but I can not even identify any titles let alone suppliers.

**Hypothesis:** The speaker can deduce textbooks exist, but cannot identify any titles or their suppliers.

1. **Existence of Textbooks:**
   - **Premise:** ""There must have been text books around at one time"" suggests that the speaker believes textbooks existed at some point.
   - **Hypothesis:** ""The speaker can deduce textbooks exist"" aligns with the premise's suggestion that textbooks existed.

2. **Identification of Titles:**
   - **Premise:** ""I can not even identify any titles"" clearly states that the speaker cannot identify any titles of the textbooks.
   - **Hypothesis:** ""cannot identify any titles"" directly matches the premise's statement.

3. **Identification of Suppliers:**
   - **Premise:** ""let alone suppliers"" indicates that the speaker cannot identify suppliers, which is an even stronger statement than not identifying titles.
   - **Hypothesis:** ""cannot identify any titles or their suppliers"" is consistent with the premise, as it includes both the inability to identify titles and suppliers.

Given these points, the Hypothesis is a restatement of the information provided in the Premise. The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise. It simply rephrases the same ideas.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

let-alone,substantive,"Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.",I have friends who have been to other countries outside Australia.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.""

### Hypothesis:
""I have friends who have been to other countries outside Australia.""

### Analysis:
1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that ""most"" of the speaker's friends have not been outside Australia.
   - The phrase ""let alone been all over the world"" emphasizes that not only have most friends not been outside Australia, but they certainly haven't traveled extensively.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis claims that the speaker has friends who have been to other countries outside Australia.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise does not state that *all* friends have never been outside Australia; it says ""most"" have not.
   - This leaves open the possibility that some friends might have traveled outside Australia, even if they are a minority.

### Conclusion:
- The hypothesis is not definitively true based on the premise, but it is also not definitively false.
- The premise allows for the possibility that some friends could have traveled outside Australia, even though most have not.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

let-alone,substantive,"Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.",I only have friends who have been to countries outside Australia.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.""

- **Key Information**: The majority of the speaker's friends have not traveled outside Australia. This implies that even fewer, if any, have traveled extensively around the world.

### Hypothesis:
""I only have friends who have been to countries outside Australia.""

- **Key Information**: The speaker claims that all of their friends have traveled to countries outside Australia.

### Analysis:
1. **Premise**: Most friends have not been outside Australia.
2. **Hypothesis**: All friends have been to countries outside Australia.

### Comparison:
- The Premise indicates that the majority of the speaker's friends have not left Australia, suggesting that it is unlikely that any significant number of them have traveled internationally.
- The Hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that all friends have traveled internationally.

### Conclusion:
Given the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true because it directly contradicts the information provided.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

### Final Answer:

let-alone,substantive,"Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.","I have a lot of friends who haven't traveled around the world, or even been outside Australia.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.""

### Hypothesis:
""I have a lot of friends who haven't traveled around the world, or even been outside Australia.""

### Analysis:
1. **Content Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that ""most of my friends haven't been outside Australia"" and emphasizes that they haven't ""been all over the world.""
   - The Hypothesis states that ""I have a lot of friends who haven't traveled around the world, or even been outside Australia.""

2. **Key Points**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that the friends have not been outside Australia.
   - Both also mention that the friends have not traveled around the world.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise. It rephrases the information given in the Premise without adding any new information or contradicting it.
   - The phrase ""a lot of friends"" in the Hypothesis is consistent with ""most of my friends"" in the Premise, as ""most"" implies a large number.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. There is no additional information or contradiction present.

### Final Relation:
0 – Entailment

Therefore, the relation is:

way-manner,partial,"As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.",She was moving forward when a knight on horseback almost ran her over.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.""
   - Key points: 
     - She was moving forward.
     - A knight on horseback galloped past her.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She was moving forward when a knight on horseback almost ran her over.""
   - Key points:
     - She was moving forward.
     - A knight on horseback almost ran her over.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that she was moving forward.
   - The Premise states that a knight on horseback galloped past her.
   - The Hypothesis states that a knight on horseback almost ran her over.

4. **Inference**:
   - The action of a knight galloping past her could reasonably be interpreted as almost running her over, given the suddenness and the speed implied by ""galloped.""
   - There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the Hypothesis. The Hypothesis is a plausible interpretation of the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

way-manner,partial,"As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.","As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback stopped to help her along.",2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.""
   - Key points: 
     - The woman is moving forward.
     - A knight on horseback gallops past her.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback stopped to help her along.""
   - Key points:
     - The woman is moving forward.
     - A knight on horseback stops to help her.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that the woman is moving forward.
   - The key difference lies in the action of the knight:
     - In the Premise, the knight gallops past her.
     - In the Hypothesis, the knight stops to help her.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions of the knight in the Premise and the Hypothesis are different and mutually exclusive.
   - If the knight gallops past her, he cannot simultaneously stop to help her.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship is a **Contradiction**.

way-manner,partial,"As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.","As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback went past her.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.""
   - Key points: 
     - The subject is moving forward.
     - A knight on horseback gallops past her.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback went past her.""
   - Key points:
     - The subject is moving forward.
     - A knight on horseback goes past her.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the subject moving forward.
   - Both mention a knight on horseback passing the subject.
   - The Premise uses ""felt her way forward"" and ""galloped past her,"" while the Hypothesis uses ""was moving forward"" and ""went past her.""
   - The differences in wording (""felt her way"" vs. ""was moving"" and ""galloped"" vs. ""went"") do not change the fundamental meaning of the events described.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because the core events and their sequence are the same.

Therefore, the relation is:

way-manner,partial,If you type in the following program exactly as listed and run it you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.,A snake-like pattern might appear on your screen when you run a specific program into your personal computer.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that if you type in a specific program exactly as listed and run it, you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis suggests that a snake-like pattern might appear on your screen when you run a specific program on your personal computer.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise guarantees that a fascinating pattern will appear if the program is typed and run exactly as listed.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that a snake-like pattern might appear, which introduces uncertainty (""might"") and does not guarantee the appearance of the pattern.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise because it is possible that the pattern described in the Premise is the same as the one mentioned in the Hypothesis.
   - However, the Hypothesis introduces uncertainty (""might"") and does not definitively state that the pattern will appear, which makes it less certain than the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that if you type in a specific program exactly as listed and run it, you will see a fascinating pattern that resembles a snake on your screen.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that nothing shows up on your computer when you run this specific program, and specifically, nothing that resembles a snake.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise asserts that running the program will result in a visible pattern resembling a snake.
   - The Hypothesis asserts the opposite, that running the program results in nothing showing up, much less a snake-like pattern.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise guarantees a specific outcome (a snake-like pattern), while the Hypothesis denies any such outcome (nothing shows up).

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

### Premise:
""If you type in the following program exactly as listed and run it you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.""

### Hypothesis:
""There's a cool snake pattern that could appear on your screen when you follow the given program and run it exactly right.""

### Analysis:
1. **Content Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that typing in a specific program exactly as listed and running it will result in a fascinating pattern that snakes across the screen.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that a cool snake pattern could appear on the screen if the given program is followed and run exactly right.

2. **Key Elements**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis mention a program that needs to be typed and run exactly.
   - Both mention a pattern appearing on the screen.
   - The Premise uses ""fascinating pattern snake its way,"" while the Hypothesis uses ""cool snake pattern.""

3. **Certainty and Modality**:
   - The Premise is definitive: ""you will see a fascinating pattern.""
   - The Hypothesis is less certain: ""could appear on your screen.""

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis is not definitively stating the same outcome as the Premise. It introduces a possibility (""could appear"") rather than a certainty (""will see"").
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

### Final Decision:
The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral** because the Hypothesis introduces a possibility rather than a certainty.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise describes a dangerous situation for miners. It mentions that a miner who slips from worn and greasy rungs could fall a long way, and a dropped tool could cause death or injury to someone below.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that a miner has tools that are valuable and costly to replace if dropped from high above while climbing.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise focuses on the danger of falling and the potential for a dropped tool to cause injury or death.
   - The hypothesis focuses on the value and cost of the tools if they are dropped.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise. It introduces a new aspect (the value and cost of the tools) that is not mentioned in the premise.
   - The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise does not provide information about the value or cost of the tools, so we cannot definitively say the hypothesis is true or false based on the premise alone.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise describes a situation where a miner who slips from worn and greasy rungs could fall a long way.
   - It also mentions that a dropped tool could clatter down and cause death or injury to someone below.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that a miner does not usually have tools that could ever cause injury to others, even if they were climbing high above someone below and slipped on a ladder.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise explicitly states that a dropped tool could cause death or injury to someone below.
   - The hypothesis contradicts this by stating that a miner does not usually have tools that could cause injury to others.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the premise. The premise asserts the potential danger of dropped tools, while the hypothesis denies this possibility.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

### Hypothesis:
""A miner could cause death or injury to an unsuspecting personal below them if they were to slip from worn out rungs and fall or drop a tool from their person.""

### Analysis:
1. **Subject Matter**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis discuss the potential dangers faced by miners due to slipping from rungs or dropping tools.

2. **Key Elements**:
   - **Premise**: 
     - A miner slipping from worn and greasy rungs.
     - Falling a long way.
     - Dropped tool causing death or injury to someone below.
   - **Hypothesis**:
     - A miner slipping from worn out rungs.
     - Falling or dropping a tool.
     - Causing death or injury to someone below.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but maintains the same essential elements:
     - Both mention the miner slipping from worn rungs.
     - Both mention the possibility of falling or dropping a tool.
     - Both mention the potential for causing death or injury to someone below.

4. **Consistency**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a paraphrase of the Premise, maintaining the same meaning and implications.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.""
   - This sentence describes a woman who is looking at two people and feeling a sense of apprehension.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension at their suggestion that she go out without a coat.""
   - This sentence also describes a woman who is looking at two people and feeling apprehension, but it adds a specific reason for her apprehension: a suggestion that she go out without a coat.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not provide any specific reason for the woman's apprehension; it only mentions that she feels apprehension.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a specific reason for the apprehension (the suggestion to go out without a coat), which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis adds additional information (the suggestion to go out without a coat) that is not present in the Premise.
   - This additional information means that the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the specific reason for the apprehension.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

way-manner,partial,"She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.","Staring from one to the other, the girl felt only confidence and strength in her body.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.""
   - Key points: The subject (she) is staring from one to the other and is feeling apprehension (a sense of fear or anxiety).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Staring from one to the other, the girl felt only confidence and strength in her body.""
   - Key points: The subject (the girl) is staring from one to the other and is feeling confidence and strength (a sense of assurance and power).

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the subject staring from one to the other.
   - The emotional states described are different: the Premise describes apprehension (fear/anxiety), while the Hypothesis describes confidence and strength (assurance/power).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The emotional states are directly contradictory. The Premise states that the subject feels apprehension, while the Hypothesis states that the subject feels confidence and strength.
   - Since these emotional states cannot coexist simultaneously in the same context, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:

Premise: She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.
Hypothesis: She felt apprehension course through her body as she stared from one to the other.

1. **Content Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a similar situation where the subject is feeling apprehension while staring from one to the other.
   - The Premise uses the phrase ""feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine,"" while the Hypothesis uses ""felt apprehension course through her body.""

2. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - ""Feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine"" and ""felt apprehension course through her body"" are semantically similar. Both describe a sensation of apprehension affecting the body.
   - The actions described (""stared from one to the other"") are identical in both the Premise and the Hypothesis.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a paraphrase of the Premise, maintaining the same meaning and context.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. Therefore, the relation is:

way-manner,partial,We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.,We picked out all of the best songs from our favorite German operas and sang our way across the rest of Europe.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

**Premise:** We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.

**Hypothesis:** We picked out all of the best songs from our favorite German operas and sang our way across the rest of Europe.

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - ""We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes""
   - ""sang our way across the rest of Europe""

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - ""We picked out all of the best songs from our favorite German operas""
   - ""sang our way across the rest of Europe""

3. **Compare the key elements:**
   - The action of picking out the best songs and singing across Europe is consistent in both the Premise and the Hypothesis.
   - The source of the songs differs: ""from the tapes"" in the Premise vs. ""from our favorite German operas"" in the Hypothesis.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The difference in the source of the songs (""tapes"" vs. ""German operas"") introduces uncertainty. The Hypothesis specifies a particular type of songs (German operas) which is not mentioned in the Premise. This means the Hypothesis could be true if the tapes included German operas, but it is not definitively supported by the Premise alone.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

**Relation: 1**",**Relation: 1**,False,True,False,1

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.""
   - This indicates that the subjects were actively engaged in singing while traveling across Europe.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""We sat in uncomfortable silence as we travelled across the rest of Europe.""
   - This suggests that the subjects were not singing but instead were silent and uncomfortable during their travel.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an active and enjoyable activity (singing) during the travel.
   - The Hypothesis describes a passive and unpleasant experience (uncomfortable silence) during the travel.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the subjects were singing, they could not have been in uncomfortable silence at the same time.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.,We had tapes playing the best picked songs we sang to across our trip of Europe.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.""
Hypothesis: ""We had tapes playing the best picked songs we sang to across our trip of Europe.""

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - **Premise**: The action described involves selecting the best songs from tapes and singing those songs while traveling across Europe.
   - **Hypothesis**: The action described involves having tapes that play the best-picked songs and singing to those songs during a trip across Europe.

2. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis mention ""best songs"" and ""tapes.""
   - The Premise explicitly states that the songs were picked from the tapes and sung while traveling.
   - The Hypothesis implies that the tapes were playing the best-picked songs and that they sang to these songs during the trip.

3. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise. It is plausible that if they picked the best songs from the tapes, they could have had those tapes playing the songs during their trip.
   - The Hypothesis does not add any information that would make it definitely true or false based on the Premise alone. It is a reasonable interpretation but not a necessary conclusion.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. It is a plausible scenario but not definitively entailed by the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

### Premise:
""She was a big, bosomy woman who couldn't work without a box of biscuits on the desk beside her, and Sarella could hear her now, crunching her way through them.""

### Hypothesis:
""Big, bosomy women love to eat a box of biscuits near them at work, even though coworkers can hear them crunching away the whole time.""

### Analysis:
1. **Specificity vs. Generalization**:
   - The Premise describes a specific woman who needs a box of biscuits to work and is currently eating them.
   - The Hypothesis generalizes this behavior to all ""big, bosomy women,"" suggesting they love to eat biscuits at work and that coworkers can hear them.

2. **Details in the Premise**:
   - The Premise mentions a specific woman and her behavior.
   - It does not provide information about other women or suggest that this behavior is common among all ""big, bosomy women.""

3. **Generalization in the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis makes a broad generalization that is not supported by the specific example in the Premise.
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to conclude that all ""big, bosomy women"" exhibit this behavior.

### Conclusion:
- The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise provides information about one specific woman, but it does not support the generalization made in the Hypothesis.
- Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Premise: ""She was a big, bosomy woman who couldn't work without a box of biscuits on the desk beside her, and Sarella could hear her now, crunching her way through them.""

Hypothesis: ""She was a big, bosomy woman who could work without a box of biscuits on the desk beside her, and Sarella could hear how quiet it was without her crunching through them.""

1. **Identify Key Information in the Premise:**
   - The woman is described as ""big"" and ""bosomy.""
   - She ""couldn't work without a box of biscuits on the desk beside her.""
   - Sarella can hear her ""crunching her way through them"" (the biscuits).

2. **Identify Key Information in the Hypothesis:**
   - The woman is described as ""big"" and ""bosomy"" (same as the Premise).
   - She ""could work without a box of biscuits on the desk beside her"" (opposite of the Premise).
   - Sarella hears ""how quiet it was without her crunching through them"" (opposite of the Premise).

3. **Compare the Key Information:**
   - The description of the woman being ""big"" and ""bosomy"" is consistent in both the Premise and Hypothesis.
   - The ability to work without biscuits is directly contradicted: the Premise states she ""couldn't work without"" them, while the Hypothesis states she ""could work without"" them.
   - The auditory detail is also directly contradicted: the Premise mentions Sarella hearing the woman ""crunching her way through"" the biscuits, while the Hypothesis mentions the quietness ""without her crunching through them.""

4. **Determine the Inference Relation:**
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise on two key points: the necessity of biscuits for work and the presence of crunching sounds.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

**Hypothesis:** 
""Sarella could hear her now, a big, bosomy woman crunching her way through a box of biscuits on her desk beside her she couldn't work without.""

1. **Identify the main components of the Premise:**
   - A big, bosomy woman.
   - She couldn't work without a box of biscuits on the desk beside her.
   - Sarella could hear her crunching her way through the biscuits.

2. **Identify the main components of the Hypothesis:**
   - Sarella could hear her now.
   - A big, bosomy woman.
   - Crunching her way through a box of biscuits on her desk beside her.
   - She couldn't work without the box of biscuits.

3. **Compare the components:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the woman as big and bosomy.
   - Both mention that she couldn't work without a box of biscuits on the desk beside her.
   - Both state that Sarella could hear her crunching her way through the biscuits.

4. **Check for consistency:**
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details.
   - The order of the information is slightly different, but the meaning remains the same.

Since the Hypothesis restates the information provided in the Premise without any contradiction or additional uncertainty, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

**Conclusion:**
The relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

way-manner,partial,A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.,A man who was no longer young moved carefully into a particular room.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""A middle-aged man"" indicates a man who is not young but not old, typically between the ages of 40 and 60.
   - ""eased his way into the room"" suggests that the man entered the room carefully or gently.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""A man who was no longer young"" describes a man who is not young, which aligns with the description of a middle-aged man.
   - ""moved carefully into a particular room"" suggests that the man entered the room with caution, which aligns with ""eased his way into the room.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a man who is not young.
   - Both describe the man entering a room carefully or gently.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and does not introduce any contradictory or additional uncertain information, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.,A middle-aged man could not get into the room.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.
Hypothesis: A middle-aged man could not get into the room.

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The Premise states that a middle-aged man successfully entered the room, albeit slowly or carefully (""eased his way"").

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis claims that a middle-aged man was unable to enter the room.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise indicates successful entry into the room.
   - The Hypothesis indicates failure to enter the room.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the man eased his way into the room, it is impossible for him to have been unable to get into the room.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.,A man of maybe fifty years moved carefully into the room.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.""
   - Key points: 
     - The subject is a ""middle-aged man.""
     - The action is ""eased his way into the room.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""A man of maybe fifty years moved carefully into the room.""
   - Key points:
     - The subject is ""a man of maybe fifty years.""
     - The action is ""moved carefully into the room.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Subject Comparison**:
     - ""Middle-aged man"" and ""a man of maybe fifty years"" are essentially equivalent. Middle-aged typically refers to someone around the age of 45-65, so ""maybe fifty years"" fits within this range.
   - **Action Comparison**:
     - ""Eased his way"" and ""moved carefully"" are similar in meaning. Both phrases suggest a gentle or cautious manner of entering the room.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis restates the Premise with slightly different wording but does not introduce any new information or contradictions.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.,I yawned three times on my journey to the Narrow Neck.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.""
   - This implies that the speaker yawned multiple times during their journey to the Narrow Neck.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I yawned three times on my journey to the Narrow Neck.""
   - This implies that the speaker yawned exactly three times during their journey to the Narrow Neck.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates yawning multiple times but does not specify the exact number of yawns.
   - The Hypothesis specifies the exact number of yawns as three.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise because yawning three times is consistent with yawning multiple times.
   - However, the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the exact number of yawns.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.,I was energized on my way back to Narrow Neck.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.""
   - This implies that the speaker was likely tired or sleepy as they made their way back to the Narrow Neck.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I was energized on my way back to Narrow Neck.""
   - This implies that the speaker was full of energy or not tired as they made their way back to Narrow Neck.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise suggests a state of tiredness or sleepiness (""yawned my way back"").
   - The Hypothesis suggests a state of being energized or not tired (""was energized on my way back"").

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The two statements describe opposite states of being (tired vs. energized).
   - Therefore, if the Premise is true (the speaker was yawning and likely tired), the Hypothesis cannot be true (the speaker was energized).

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.,I yawned at least once on my journey back to the Narrow Neck.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.""
   - This sentence indicates that the speaker yawned multiple times during their journey back to the Narrow Neck.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I yawned at least once on my journey back to the Narrow Neck.""
   - This sentence suggests that the speaker yawned at least one time during their journey back to the Narrow Neck.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker yawned multiple times (""yawned my way back""), which implies yawning at least once.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker yawned at least once.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the speaker yawned multiple times, it is definitely true that they yawned at least once.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.,I bought my flight ticket with ease onto the same flight as other passengers.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.""
Hypothesis: ""I bought my flight ticket with ease onto the same flight as other passengers.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The Premise states that it was easy for the speaker to buy their way onto a specific flight.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker bought their flight ticket with ease onto the same flight as other passengers.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis indicate that the speaker was able to buy a flight ticket easily.
   - The Hypothesis adds the detail that the flight is the same as that of other passengers, which is a reasonable assumption given the context of buying a ticket for a flight.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a paraphrase of the Premise with a slight elaboration that does not change the meaning.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.,It was a hard feat to buy my way onto the same flight.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.""
   - This statement indicates that the action of buying a ticket for the same flight was not difficult.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""It was a hard feat to buy my way onto the same flight.""
   - This statement indicates that the action of buying a ticket for the same flight was difficult.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that buying the ticket was easy.
   - The Hypothesis states that buying the ticket was hard.
   - These two statements are directly contradictory because one describes the action as easy and the other as hard.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.,It came easily for me to buy a ticket on the same flight.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.""
   - This means that the speaker found it easy to purchase a ticket for the same flight.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""It came easily for me to buy a ticket on the same flight.""
   - This means that the speaker found it easy to purchase a ticket for the same flight.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same idea: the speaker found it easy to buy a ticket for the same flight.
   - The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is identical.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.,Constance was looking for first-class carriages to take a ride on.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.""
   - This indicates that Constance is actively searching for first-class carriages on a platform.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Constance was looking for first-class carriages to take a ride on.""
   - This suggests that Constance's purpose for looking for the first-class carriages is to take a ride on them.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Constance is looking for first-class carriages.
   - The Hypothesis adds the reason for this search, which is to take a ride on them.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis logically extends the information given in the Premise by providing a plausible reason for Constance's search.
   - There is no contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis.
   - The Hypothesis is a reasonable assumption based on the Premise, but it is not explicitly stated in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise alone, as the Premise does not explicitly state the reason for Constance's search.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.,Constance waited in line for the first-class carriages.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.""
   - This indicates that Constance is actively moving along the platform with the intention of finding the first-class carriages.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Constance waited in line for the first-class carriages.""
   - This suggests that Constance is standing in a line, waiting for the first-class carriages.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes Constance moving along the platform, while the Hypothesis describes her waiting in line.
   - These two actions are different: moving along the platform vs. standing in line.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise explicitly stated that Constance was waiting in line, which it does not.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true or false based on the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny that Constance waited in line.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise explicitly stated that Constance did not wait in line, which it does not.

Given that the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the action of waiting in line, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.,Constance was looking for first-class carriages as she squeezed her way down to the platform.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.""
   - This sentence indicates that Constance is on a platform and is actively searching for first-class carriages while moving through the platform.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Constance was looking for first-class carriages as she squeezed her way down to the platform.""
   - This sentence suggests that Constance is looking for first-class carriages while moving down to the platform.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis involve Constance looking for first-class carriages.
   - The main difference is the direction or location of movement: 
     - The Premise states she is moving ""down the platform.""
     - The Hypothesis states she is moving ""down to the platform.""

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis both describe Constance's action of looking for first-class carriages.
   - The slight difference in wording (""down the platform"" vs. ""down to the platform"") does not significantly alter the meaning in a way that would make the Hypothesis definitely true or false based on the Premise.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.,The practical man thought about the obstacles to his finding an affordable home.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.""
   - This statement indicates that a practical man is thinking through some obstacles. It does not specify what the obstacles are.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The practical man thought about the obstacles to his finding an affordable home.""
   - This statement specifies that the practical man is thinking about obstacles related to finding an affordable home.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions ""apparent obstacles"" without specifying what they are.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that the obstacles are related to finding an affordable home.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis introduces a specific context (finding an affordable home) that is not mentioned in the Premise.
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the specific context introduced in the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.,The careless man did not have to think about his easy going life.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.""
   - This sentence describes a practical man who is actively thinking and overcoming obstacles.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The careless man did not have to think about his easy going life.""
   - This sentence describes a careless man who does not think and has an easy-going life.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about a practical man who is thoughtful and dealing with obstacles.
   - The Hypothesis talks about a careless man who does not think and has an easy life.
   - The two descriptions are about different types of men with contrasting characteristics: one is practical and thoughtful, while the other is careless and carefree.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not directly relate to the Premise in a way that it can be inferred as true or false based on the Premise.
   - The characteristics of the practical man in the Premise do not provide any information about the careless man in the Hypothesis.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.,The practical man had obstacles he could think his way through.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.""
Hypothesis: ""The practical man had obstacles he could think his way through.""

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - **Premise:** A practical man encountered obstacles and managed to think his way through them.
   - **Hypothesis:** A practical man had obstacles that he was capable of thinking his way through.

2. **Compare the Statements:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention a practical man dealing with obstacles.
   - The Premise states that the practical man actually thought his way through the obstacles.
   - The Hypothesis states that the practical man had obstacles that he could think his way through, implying the potential or capability to do so.

3. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it is consistent with the idea that the practical man had obstacles he could think his way through.
   - The Hypothesis is a general statement about the capability, while the Premise provides a specific instance of this capability being realized.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - Since the Hypothesis is a generalization of the specific instance provided in the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The Court's apparent detachment from politics is made possible by its nonelective status.""
   - This means that the Court is perceived to be detached from politics because its members are not elected.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The Court's apparent detachment from politics is clear from the stately décor of the courtroom.""
   - This suggests that the detachment from politics is evident from the appearance or decoration of the courtroom.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides a reason for the Court's detachment from politics (its nonelective status).
   - The Hypothesis provides a different reason or evidence for the Court's detachment from politics (the stately décor of the courtroom).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not directly contradict the Premise, as it is possible for both the nonelective status and the stately décor to contribute to the perception of detachment from politics.
   - However, the Hypothesis introduces a new piece of information that is not mentioned in the Premise.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the Hypothesis.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1. **Identify Key Information in the Premise:**
   - Justin Timberlake is involved in a new rom-com.
   - The title of the rom-com is ""The Last Drop.""
   - The rom-com deals with alcoholism.
   - The phrase ""makes alcoholism fun"" suggests a comedic or light-hearted approach to the topic.

2. **Identify Key Information in the Hypothesis:**
   - Justin Timberlake sings a hit song.
   - The rom-com is called ""The Last Drop.""
   - The rom-com deals with alcoholism.

3. **Compare the Information:**
   - The Premise does not mention anything about Justin Timberlake singing a hit song.
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis agree on the title of the rom-com (""The Last Drop"") and that it deals with alcoholism.

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information (Justin Timberlake singing a hit song) that is not present in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise, but it also cannot be confirmed solely based on the information given in the Premise.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Justin Timberlake MAKES Alcoholism Fun In The New Rom-Com The Last Drop.""
   - This indicates that Justin Timberlake is involved in making alcoholism appear fun in a new romantic comedy titled ""The Last Drop.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Justin Timberlake does not make alcoholism look fun in the old rom-com The Last Drop.""
   - This suggests that Justin Timberlake does not make alcoholism appear fun in an old romantic comedy titled ""The Last Drop.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise and hypothesis are discussing the same movie, ""The Last Drop,"" but they differ in two key aspects:
     - The premise refers to it as a ""new"" rom-com, while the hypothesis refers to it as an ""old"" rom-com.
     - The premise states that Justin Timberlake makes alcoholism look fun, while the hypothesis states the opposite, that he does not make alcoholism look fun.

   - This suggests that Justin Timberlake is in a new romantic comedy titled ""The Last Drop,"" and in this movie, he makes the topic of alcoholism interesting.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis agree that Justin Timberlake is in a new rom-com called ""The Last Drop.""
   - The premise uses the word ""fun"" to describe how Justin Timberlake handles the topic of alcoholism, while the hypothesis uses the word ""interesting.""
   - The terms ""fun"" and ""interesting"" are not identical but are closely related in this context. Making something fun can often make it interesting as well, though the exact nuance might differ slightly.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis does not contradict the premise; it is plausible that making alcoholism fun could also make it interesting.
   - The hypothesis is not definitively true based on the premise alone because ""fun"" and ""interesting"" are not exact synonyms, but they are closely related enough to make the hypothesis plausible.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.,This nice man has a mother who will kiss him to the point of unconsciousness.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.""
   - The phrase suggests that the man desires to be kissed by ""Mother"" to the point of losing consciousness. The use of ""probably"" indicates some level of uncertainty or speculation.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""This nice man has a mother who will kiss him to the point of unconsciousness.""
   - This statement asserts that the man has a mother who will indeed kiss him until he becomes unconscious. It presents this as a definite fact.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise suggests a desire or wish (""probably just wanted"") for ""Mother"" to kiss him unconscious, but it does not confirm that this will happen or that ""Mother"" is indeed his mother.
   - The Hypothesis, on the other hand, states as a fact that the man has a mother who will kiss him to the point of unconsciousness.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm the Hypothesis. The Premise is speculative and does not establish the relationship or the action as a certainty.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.,This bad man has a mother that he never wants to lay a kiss on him.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.""
Hypothesis: ""This bad man has a mother that he never wants to lay a kiss on him.""

1. **Identify the main subjects and actions in the Premise:**
   - Subject: ""This nice man""
   - Action: ""wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious""

2. **Identify the main subjects and actions in the Hypothesis:**
   - Subject: ""This bad man""
   - Action: ""has a mother that he never wants to lay a kiss on him""

3. **Compare the subjects:**
   - The Premise talks about ""This nice man.""
   - The Hypothesis talks about ""This bad man.""

4. **Compare the actions and desires:**
   - The Premise suggests that the nice man wants Mother to kiss him unconscious.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that the bad man has a mother and he never wants her to kiss him.

5. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Premise and Hypothesis talk about different men (one nice, one bad) with different desires regarding kisses from their mothers.
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the bad man or his desires.
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information that is not related to the Premise.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise because the Premise does not provide any information about the bad man or his relationship with his mother.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is Neutral.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.,"This nice man probably just wanted Mother to kiss him, causing him to be unconscious.",0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.""
   - The phrase ""kiss him unconscious"" suggests that the man wanted a kiss from Mother that would result in him becoming unconscious.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to kiss him, causing him to be unconscious.""
   - This hypothesis rephrases the premise, indicating that the kiss from Mother would cause the man to become unconscious.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same idea: the man wants a kiss from Mother that would result in him becoming unconscious.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise. It simply rephrases the same idea in a slightly different way.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.,I had brushed my hair until it felt soft.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.""
Hypothesis: ""I had brushed my hair until it felt soft.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The speaker has brushed their hair to the point where it is very smooth.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker has brushed their hair until it felt soft.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - ""Very smooth"" and ""soft"" are related but not identical descriptions. Smoothness refers to the texture being even and free of tangles, while softness refers to the tactile quality of the hair.
   - Brushing hair to make it smooth does not necessarily mean it will feel soft, and vice versa. They are related but not equivalent outcomes.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the hair felt soft, only that it was smooth.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.,I had brushed my nonexistent hair roughly.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker has hair and that they brushed it in a manner that made it smooth.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""I had brushed my nonexistent hair roughly.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker does not have hair (nonexistent hair) and that they brushed it roughly.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker has hair and brushed it smoothly.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker does not have hair and brushed it roughly.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the speaker has hair and brushed it smoothly, it is impossible for them to have nonexistent hair and brush it roughly at the same time.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.,I had very smooth hair because I brushed it.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: ""I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.""
Hypothesis: ""I had very smooth hair because I brushed it.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The speaker states that they brushed their hair and as a result, it became very smooth.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The speaker claims that their hair is very smooth due to the action of brushing it.

3. **Checking for Entailment**: 
   - The Premise indicates that the action of brushing led to the hair becoming very smooth.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially rephrasing the Premise by stating the cause (brushing) and the effect (smooth hair).

4. **Evaluating the Relationship**:
   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise. If the hair was brushed very smooth, it implies that the hair is smooth because of the brushing.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any uncertainty or additional conditions that would make it only possibly true.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,You KILLED it stone-dead.,You killed someone.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The phrase ""You KILLED it stone-dead"" is an idiomatic expression.
   - In this context, ""killed it"" typically means to perform exceptionally well at something, not to literally kill someone or something.
   - ""Stone-dead"" emphasizes the finality or completeness of the action, reinforcing the idiomatic meaning.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis ""You killed someone"" is a literal interpretation.
   - It suggests that a person was killed, which is a specific and literal event.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise uses an idiomatic expression that means performing very well, not a literal killing.
   - The Hypothesis interprets the action as a literal killing of a person.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the idiomatic nature of the Premise, it does not support the literal interpretation of the Hypothesis.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,You KILLED it stone-dead.,You caused it to be more alive.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""You KILLED it stone-dead.""
   - The phrase ""killed it stone-dead"" implies that something was made completely lifeless or dead. The use of ""stone-dead"" emphasizes the finality and totality of the action.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""You caused it to be more alive.""
   - This statement suggests that the action resulted in something becoming more alive, which is the opposite of being dead.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that something was killed and made completely dead.
   - The Hypothesis states that the same thing was made more alive.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If something is killed and made stone-dead, it cannot simultaneously be made more alive. These two statements are mutually exclusive and directly contradict each other.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,You KILLED it stone-dead.,It was stone-dead as a result of you killing it.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: ""You KILLED it stone-dead.""
Hypothesis: ""It was stone-dead as a result of you killing it.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The phrase ""You KILLED it stone-dead"" implies that the action of killing resulted in the state of being ""stone-dead."" The term ""stone-dead"" emphasizes that the subject is completely and utterly dead.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The Hypothesis states, ""It was stone-dead as a result of you killing it."" This means that the state of being ""stone-dead"" is a direct consequence of the action of killing.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The Premise explicitly states that the action of killing resulted in the subject being ""stone-dead.""
   - The Hypothesis restates this relationship by indicating that the subject was ""stone-dead"" because of the killing action.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is a direct restatement of the consequence described in the Premise.
   - There is no additional information or ambiguity introduced in the Hypothesis that would make it uncertain or contradictory.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The tools were WIPED clean.,The tools were cleaned with a cloth.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""The tools were WIPED clean.""
   - This statement indicates that the tools were cleaned by wiping them. It does not specify the method or material used for wiping.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""The tools were cleaned with a cloth.""
   - This statement suggests that the tools were cleaned using a cloth.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the tools were wiped clean, which implies a cleaning action that could involve a cloth, but it does not explicitly mention a cloth.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that a cloth was used for cleaning.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true, the Premise must explicitly state that a cloth was used. Since the Premise does not specify the use of a cloth, we cannot be certain that the Hypothesis is definitely true.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise allows for the possibility that a cloth was used, but it does not confirm it. Therefore, the Hypothesis is plausible but not guaranteed.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise explicitly stated that a different method or material was used for wiping. Since the Premise does not contradict the use of a cloth, this relation does not apply.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,The tools were WIPED clean.,The tools were extremely dirty.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The tools were WIPED clean.""
   - This statement indicates that the tools were cleaned, implying that any dirt or contaminants were removed.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""The tools were extremely dirty.""
   - This statement suggests that the tools were in a very dirty state.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the tools were cleaned, which means they are no longer dirty.
   - The Hypothesis states that the tools were extremely dirty, which directly contradicts the idea that they were cleaned.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Final Relation Output: 2",Final Relation Output: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The tools were WIPED clean.,The tools were clean because they were wiped.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: The tools were WIPED clean.
Hypothesis: The tools were clean because they were wiped.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The statement ""The tools were WIPED clean"" indicates that an action (wiping) was performed on the tools, resulting in them being clean.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The statement ""The tools were clean because they were wiped"" suggests a causal relationship, stating that the reason the tools are clean is due to the action of wiping.

3. **Checking for Entailment**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment of the Premise, the Hypothesis must be definitely true given the Premise. The Premise states that the tools were wiped clean, which implies that the tools are clean as a result of being wiped. This directly supports the causal relationship stated in the Hypothesis.

4. **Checking for Neutrality**: For the Hypothesis to be neutral, it would mean that the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. However, in this case, the Premise clearly supports the Hypothesis, so neutrality does not apply.

5. **Checking for Contradiction**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, it would mean that the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. There is no contradiction here, as the Premise supports the Hypothesis.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The river FROZE solid.,The river was cold.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise: The river FROZE solid.**
   - This statement indicates that the river's water turned into a solid state due to freezing temperatures.

2. **Hypothesis: The river was cold.**
   - This statement suggests that the temperature of the river was low enough to be considered cold.

3. **Analysis:**
   - If the river froze solid, it implies that the temperature was below the freezing point of water. For water to freeze, it must be at or below 0°C (32°F). Therefore, if the river froze solid, it must have been cold.
   - The Hypothesis is a less specific statement about the temperature of the river compared to the Premise. The Premise provides a stronger condition (freezing solid) which inherently includes the condition of being cold.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that the Premise states the river froze solid, it is definitely true that the river was cold. The Hypothesis is a necessary condition for the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

**Relation: 0**",**Relation: 0**,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The river FROZE solid.,The river had melted into liquid.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: The river FROZE solid.
Hypothesis: The river had melted into liquid.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The statement ""The river FROZE solid"" indicates that the river has turned into a solid state due to freezing. This implies that the temperature is below the freezing point of water, and the river is currently in a solid state.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The statement ""The river had melted into liquid"" suggests that the river was previously in a solid state and has now turned into a liquid state due to melting. This implies that the temperature has risen above the freezing point, causing the solid ice to melt into liquid water.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise states that the river is currently in a solid state (frozen).
   - The Hypothesis states that the river is currently in a liquid state (melted).

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - If the river is frozen solid, it cannot simultaneously be in a liquid state. These two states are mutually exclusive.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The river FROZE solid.,The river is frozen solid.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: The river FROZE solid.
Hypothesis: The river is frozen solid.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that the river underwent the process of freezing and is now in a solid state.
2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that the river is currently in a frozen solid state.
3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise indicates a completed action (the river froze solid), which implies that the river is now in a frozen solid state.
   - The Hypothesis describes the current state of the river as being frozen solid.

Given that the Premise directly leads to the conclusion that the river is frozen solid, the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the information provided in the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,It BROKE apart.,It broke into pieces by hand.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""It BROKE apart.""
   - This statement indicates that something has broken into separate parts. It does not specify how it broke or what caused it to break.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""It broke into pieces by hand.""
   - This statement specifies that the breaking was done by hand, implying a specific cause or method for the breaking.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that ""it broke apart,"" which is a general statement about the result (something is now in pieces).
   - The Hypothesis adds additional information by specifying the method of breaking (""by hand"").

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the breaking was done by hand. The Premise does not provide this specific detail.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the method of breaking. The breaking could have been done by hand, but it could also have been done by other means (e.g., by a machine, by accident, etc.).
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly conflicts with the idea that the breaking was done by hand. The Premise does not provide any such conflicting information.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,It BROKE apart.,It was put together.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise: ""It BROKE apart.""**
   - This statement indicates that something was in a state of being broken or separated into pieces.

2. **Hypothesis: ""It was put together.""**
   - This statement suggests that something was in a state of being assembled or combined into a whole.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise states that the object is in a broken state.
   - The Hypothesis states that the object is in an assembled state.

4. **Inference Analysis:**
   - If something is broken apart, it cannot simultaneously be put together. These two states are mutually exclusive.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

**Relation Output: 2**",**Relation Output: 2**,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,It BROKE apart.,It was severed into more than one piece.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""It BROKE apart.""
   - This indicates that something has broken into separate parts.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""It was severed into more than one piece.""
   - This suggests that something was cut or split into multiple pieces.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The term ""broke apart"" implies that the object is no longer whole and has been divided into parts.
   - The term ""severed into more than one piece"" also implies that the object is no longer whole and has been divided into multiple pieces.

4. **Inference**:
   - Both statements describe a situation where an object is divided into multiple parts.
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise with a focus on the result of the action (being in more than one piece).

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,He HAMMERED the metal flat.,He was making a sword by hammering metal.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He HAMMERED the metal flat.""
   - This statement indicates that someone used a hammer to flatten a piece of metal.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He was making a sword by hammering metal.""
   - This statement suggests that the person was engaged in the process of sword-making, specifically by hammering metal.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides information about hammering metal flat, but it does not specify the purpose or the end product of this action.
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information that the purpose of hammering the metal was to make a sword.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true, the Premise must explicitly or implicitly confirm that the metal was being hammered to make a sword. The Premise does not provide this information.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not rule out the possibility that the metal was being hammered to make a sword, but it also does not confirm it.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false, the Premise would need to provide information that contradicts the idea of making a sword. The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis.

Given that the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the specific purpose of making a sword, the relationship is best described as Neutral.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,He HAMMERED the metal flat.,He enflated the metal into a balloon.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He HAMMERED the metal flat.""
   - This indicates that the person used a hammer to make the metal flat. The action of hammering typically involves applying force to shape or flatten an object.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""He enflated the metal into a balloon.""
   - This suggests that the person somehow made the metal expand or inflate into the shape of a balloon. Inflating typically involves expanding something by filling it with air or gas, which is quite different from hammering.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Hammering metal flat involves compressing and flattening it.
   - Inflating metal into a balloon involves expanding it, which is the opposite of flattening.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are contradictory. Hammering metal flat and inflating metal into a balloon are mutually exclusive actions; one cannot flatten and inflate the same piece of metal simultaneously.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,He HAMMERED the metal flat.,He flattened the metal by hammering.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: ""He HAMMERED the metal flat.""
Hypothesis: ""He flattened the metal by hammering.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that an individual used a hammer to make the metal flat. This implies that the action of hammering resulted in the metal becoming flat.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that the individual flattened the metal by using a hammer. This implies that the method used to flatten the metal was hammering.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The action described in the Premise (hammering the metal flat) directly leads to the result described in the Hypothesis (flattening the metal by hammering).
   - There is a clear cause-and-effect relationship between the action (hammering) and the result (flattening the metal).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise in a different wording but conveys the same information.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The dog BARKED the chickens awake.,The dog likes to wake the chickens up by barking.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: The dog BARKED the chickens awake.
Hypothesis: The dog likes to wake the chickens up by barking.

1. **Identify the key information in the Premise:**
   - The dog barked.
   - The barking caused the chickens to wake up.

2. **Identify the key information in the Hypothesis:**
   - The dog likes to wake the chickens up.
   - The method of waking the chickens is by barking.

3. **Compare the information:**
   - The Premise states a specific event where the dog barked and as a result, the chickens woke up.
   - The Hypothesis makes a general statement about the dog's preference or habit of waking the chickens by barking.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Premise does not provide information about the dog's preferences or habits; it only describes a single event.
   - The Hypothesis introduces an additional element (the dog's liking or habit) that is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.

Since the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the dog's preference or habit of waking the chickens by barking, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,The dog BARKED the chickens awake.,The dog was silent because there were chickens.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The dog BARKED the chickens awake.""
- This statement indicates that the dog made a barking noise, which caused the chickens to wake up.

Hypothesis: ""The dog was silent because there were chickens.""
- This statement suggests that the dog did not make any noise (was silent) due to the presence of chickens.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

1. **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, it must be definitely true given the Premise. However, the Premise states that the dog barked, which directly contradicts the Hypothesis that the dog was silent. Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be definitely true given the Premise.

2. **Neutral (1)**: For the Hypothesis to be neutral, it must be possible that the Hypothesis is true or false given the Premise. In this case, the Premise explicitly states that the dog barked, which makes it impossible for the Hypothesis to be true. Therefore, the Hypothesis is not neutral.

3. **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, it must be impossible for the Hypothesis to be true given the Premise. Since the Premise states that the dog barked and the Hypothesis states that the dog was silent, these two statements cannot both be true simultaneously. Therefore, the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Based on this analysis, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The dog BARKED the chickens awake.,The chickens woke to the dog's bark.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: The dog BARKED the chickens awake.
Hypothesis: The chickens woke to the dog's bark.

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The premise states that the dog barked, and as a result, the chickens woke up. The barking of the dog is the cause, and the waking of the chickens is the effect.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis states that the chickens woke up because of the dog's bark. This implies that the waking of the chickens was due to the dog's barking.

3. **Comparing the Premise and the Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis directly aligns with the premise. The premise provides a cause-and-effect relationship where the dog's barking caused the chickens to wake up.
   - The hypothesis restates this relationship by saying the chickens woke up due to the dog's bark.

4. **Determining the Relation:**
   - Since the hypothesis is a restatement of the cause-and-effect relationship given in the premise, it is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,Terry WIPED the table clean.,Terry had cleaned the table to eat.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""Terry WIPED the table clean.""
   - This statement indicates that Terry performed an action (wiping) that resulted in the table being clean.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""Terry had cleaned the table to eat.""
   - This statement suggests that Terry cleaned the table with the purpose of eating.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise confirms that Terry wiped the table clean, but it does not provide any information about the reason or purpose behind this action.
   - The Hypothesis introduces an additional detail (the purpose of eating) that is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise explicitly stated that Terry cleaned the table to eat. However, the Premise does not provide this purpose.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, but it also does not confirm the purpose of cleaning the table.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise explicitly stated a different purpose for cleaning the table, but it does not.

Given that the Premise does not provide information about the purpose of cleaning the table, the Hypothesis remains a possibility but is not confirmed. Therefore, the relationship is Neutral.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Terry WIPED the table clean.,Terry wiped the table with a greasy rag until it was black.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""Terry WIPED the table clean.""
   - This means that Terry performed an action (wiping) on the table, and as a result, the table became clean.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""Terry wiped the table with a greasy rag until it was black.""
   - This suggests that Terry used a greasy rag to wipe the table, and the table became black as a result.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the table ended up clean after Terry wiped it.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that the table ended up black after Terry wiped it with a greasy rag.

4. **Inference**:
   - The outcomes described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are mutually exclusive. If the table is clean, it cannot be black from grease, and vice versa.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Terry WIPED the table clean.,The table was clean because Terry wiped it down.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""Terry WIPED the table clean.""
   - This statement indicates that Terry performed an action (wiping) that resulted in the table being clean.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""The table was clean because Terry wiped it down.""
   - This statement suggests that the table's cleanliness is a direct result of Terry's action of wiping it down.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. If Terry wiped the table clean, it logically follows that the table was clean because of Terry's action.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Premise did not provide enough information to confirm the Hypothesis.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Premise directly opposed the Hypothesis.

Given the Premise ""Terry WIPED the table clean,"" it directly supports the Hypothesis ""The table was clean because Terry wiped it down."" The action of wiping the table clean implies that the table's cleanliness is due to Terry's wiping.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,Terry PUSHED the door shut.,Terry closed the door with his side.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""Terry PUSHED the door shut.""
   - This indicates that Terry used some form of pushing action to close the door.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""Terry closed the door with his side.""
   - This suggests that Terry used his side (part of his body) to close the door.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Terry pushed the door shut, but it does not specify how he pushed it (e.g., with his hands, his side, his back, etc.).
   - The Hypothesis specifies that Terry used his side to close the door, which is a specific form of pushing.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is a specific instance of the general action described in the Premise. The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, nor does it confirm it explicitly. The Hypothesis is a plausible scenario given the Premise but is not definitively true based on the information provided.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Terry PUSHED the door shut.,Terry opened the door wide.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""Terry PUSHED the door shut.""
   - This indicates that Terry applied force to close the door.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""Terry opened the door wide.""
   - This suggests that Terry made the door fully open.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The action of pushing the door shut (closing it) is directly opposite to the action of opening the door wide (making it fully open).
   - If Terry pushed the door shut, it is not possible for the door to be wide open at the same time.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Final Relation Output: 2",Final Relation Output: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Terry PUSHED the door shut.,Terry shut the door by pushing it closed.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: Terry PUSHED the door shut.
Hypothesis: Terry shut the door by pushing it closed.

1. **Identify the main action in the Premise:**
   - The main action is ""Terry PUSHED the door shut.""

2. **Identify the main action in the Hypothesis:**
   - The main action is ""Terry shut the door by pushing it closed.""

3. **Compare the actions and their descriptions:**
   - The Premise states that Terry pushed the door shut.
   - The Hypothesis states that Terry shut the door by pushing it closed.

4. **Check for consistency:**
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. Both statements describe the same action (Terry shutting the door by pushing it).

5. **Determine the relationship:**
   - Since the Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,He ATE himself sick.,He ate questionably fresh shellfish.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: ""He ATE himself sick.""
Hypothesis: ""He ate questionably fresh shellfish.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise states that ""He ATE himself sick,"" which means he consumed food to the point of making himself ill. The specific type of food is not mentioned.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis states that ""He ate questionably fresh shellfish,"" which implies he consumed shellfish that may not have been fresh, potentially leading to illness.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The premise indicates that the person ate something that made him sick.
   - The hypothesis suggests a specific type of food (questionably fresh shellfish) that could plausibly cause illness.

4. **Inference Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis provides a possible explanation for the premise but does not definitively follow from it. The premise does not specify what was eaten, so while the hypothesis is a plausible scenario, it is not the only possible scenario.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. It is one of many possible explanations for why he became sick from eating.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,He ATE himself sick.,He didn't eat.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: He ATE himself sick.
Hypothesis: He didn't eat.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that ""He ATE himself sick,"" which means he ate so much that it made him feel sick.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that ""He didn't eat,"" which means he did not consume any food.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise clearly indicates that he ate a significant amount of food.
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that he did not eat at all.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - Since the Hypothesis states the exact opposite of what the Premise indicates, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,He ATE himself sick.,He felt sick from eating.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He ATE himself sick.""
   - This means that the person ate so much or something so bad that it caused him to feel sick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""He felt sick from eating.""
   - This means that the person felt sick as a result of eating.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the person ate to the point of feeling sick.
   - The Hypothesis states that the person felt sick as a result of eating.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is a direct consequence of the Premise. If someone ate themselves sick, it logically follows that they felt sick from eating.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,She COUGHED herself sick.,She coughed too much from choking.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: She COUGHED herself sick.
Hypothesis: She coughed too much from choking.

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The phrase ""She COUGHED herself sick"" implies that she coughed to the extent that it made her feel unwell or sick.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The phrase ""She coughed too much from choking"" suggests that the reason for her excessive coughing was choking.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The Premise indicates the result of coughing (becoming sick) but does not specify the cause of the coughing.
   - The Hypothesis provides a specific cause for the coughing (choking) but does not directly address the result (becoming sick).

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The Premise does not confirm or deny the cause of the coughing. It only states the outcome (sickness).
   - The Hypothesis introduces a potential cause (choking) which is not mentioned in the Premise.

Given that the Premise does not provide information about the cause of the coughing, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,She COUGHED herself sick.,Her coughing resulted in her feeling better.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""She COUGHED herself sick.""
   - This means that due to her coughing, she became sick. The act of coughing led to a negative health outcome.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""Her coughing resulted in her feeling better.""
   - This means that the act of coughing led to a positive health outcome, specifically feeling better.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that coughing made her sick, which is a negative outcome.
   - The Hypothesis states that coughing made her feel better, which is a positive outcome.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis present opposite outcomes from the same action (coughing). The Premise indicates a negative result (sickness), while the Hypothesis indicates a positive result (feeling better).
   - Since these outcomes are directly contradictory, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,She COUGHED herself sick.,She got sick from coughing.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: She COUGHED herself sick.
Hypothesis: She got sick from coughing.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The phrase ""She COUGHED herself sick"" implies that the act of coughing led to her becoming sick. The use of ""herself"" indicates that the action of coughing directly caused her to become sick.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis ""She got sick from coughing"" states that the reason for her sickness is due to coughing.

3. **Comparing the Statements**: 
   - The premise explicitly states that coughing led to her becoming sick.
   - The hypothesis also states that she got sick as a result of coughing.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis is a direct restatement of the cause-and-effect relationship described in the premise.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction present in the hypothesis compared to the premise.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

resultative,schematic,The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.,The jackhammer pounding sometimes reaches 130 decibels.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.""
   - This statement indicates that the jackhammer was extremely loud, to the point of causing deafness.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""The jackhammer pounding sometimes reaches 130 decibels.""
   - This statement provides a specific measurement of the jackhammer's noise level, suggesting that it can reach 130 decibels.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes the effect of the jackhammer's noise on people (causing deafness).
   - The Hypothesis provides a factual statement about the noise level of the jackhammer (130 decibels).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not provide specific decibel levels, only the effect of the noise.
   - The Hypothesis does not directly confirm or deny the effect described in the Premise but provides additional information about the noise level.
   - The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it is not necessarily entailed by it. The Premise does not specify decibel levels, so we cannot definitively conclude the Hypothesis from the Premise alone.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.,The jackhammer was easy on our ears.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.""
   - This means that the jackhammer was extremely loud, to the point that it caused deafness or a significant impact on hearing.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The jackhammer was easy on our ears.""
   - This means that the jackhammer was not loud and did not cause any discomfort to the ears.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the jackhammer was very loud and caused deafness.
   - The Hypothesis states that the jackhammer was not loud and was easy on the ears.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the jackhammer pounded them deaf, it cannot be easy on their ears.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.,We were deaf from the jackhammering.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.""
   - This statement indicates that the action of the jackhammer was so intense that it caused deafness.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""We were deaf from the jackhammering.""
   - This statement suggests that the cause of the deafness was the jackhammering.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the jackhammer caused deafness.
   - The Hypothesis states that the deafness was caused by the jackhammering.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise. The cause (jackhammering) and the effect (deafness) are explicitly connected in both statements.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

resultative,schematic,Water FILLED the tub half full.,The half-full tub was dirty.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Water FILLED the tub half full.""
   - This means that water was added to the tub until it reached the halfway mark.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The half-full tub was dirty.""
   - This statement is about the condition of the tub, specifically that it was dirty when it was half full.

3. **Inference Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the tub was dirty. The Premise only states that the tub was filled halfway with water; it does not provide any information about the cleanliness of the tub.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true or false based on the Premise. The Premise does not give any information about the cleanliness of the tub, so it is possible that the tub was dirty or clean.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that directly opposes the Hypothesis. The Premise does not mention anything about the tub being clean or dirty, so there is no direct contradiction.

Given the analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Water FILLED the tub half full.,Water drained from the tub.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: Water FILLED the tub half full.
Hypothesis: Water drained from the tub.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise states that water filled the tub to the halfway point. This means that at some point, water was added to the tub until it reached half its capacity.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis states that water drained from the tub. This implies that water was removed from the tub.

3. **Checking for Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be definitely true given the premise, the premise must provide information that directly supports the hypothesis. The premise only mentions the filling of the tub, not the draining of water. Therefore, the hypothesis is not definitely true based on the premise alone.

4. **Checking for Contradiction (2)**: For the hypothesis to be definitely false given the premise, the premise must provide information that directly contradicts the hypothesis. The premise does not state that water cannot be drained from the tub; it only mentions that the tub was filled halfway. Therefore, the hypothesis is not directly contradicted by the premise.

5. **Checking for Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise does not provide enough information to determine whether water was drained from the tub after it was filled halfway. It is possible that water could have been drained after being filled, but it is also possible that it was not drained.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Water FILLED the tub half full.,The tub was half full of water.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""Water FILLED the tub half full.""
   - This means that water was added to the tub until it reached the halfway mark.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""The tub was half full of water.""
   - This statement asserts that the tub contained water up to the halfway mark.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that water filled the tub to the halfway point.
   - The Hypothesis states that the tub was half full of water.

4. **Inference**:
   - If water filled the tub to the halfway point, it logically follows that the tub was half full of water.
   - There is no additional information or context needed to confirm this; the Hypothesis is a direct restatement of the condition described in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

resultative,schematic,The sleeping pills MADE me sick.,I took sleeping pills before bed.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: The sleeping pills MADE me sick.
Hypothesis: I took sleeping pills before bed.

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The Premise states that the speaker took sleeping pills and as a result, they felt sick.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The Hypothesis suggests that the speaker took sleeping pills before going to bed.

3. **Checking for Entailment:**
   - For the Hypothesis to be entailed by the Premise, the Premise must provide enough information to make the Hypothesis definitely true.
   - The Premise does indicate that the speaker took sleeping pills, but it does not specify the time of day when the pills were taken. Therefore, it is not certain that the pills were taken before bed.

4. **Checking for Contradiction:**
   - For the Hypothesis to be contradicted by the Premise, the Premise must provide information that makes the Hypothesis definitely false.
   - There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the idea of taking sleeping pills before bed.

5. **Checking for Neutrality:**
   - If the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, then the relation is neutral.
   - Since the Premise does not specify when the sleeping pills were taken, the Hypothesis could be true (if the pills were taken before bed) or false (if the pills were taken at some other time).

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

resultative,schematic,The sleeping pills MADE me sick.,The sleeping pills make me feel good.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: ""The sleeping pills MADE me sick.""
Hypothesis: ""The sleeping pills make me feel good.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The Premise states that the sleeping pills caused the speaker to feel sick. This indicates a negative reaction to the sleeping pills.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that the sleeping pills make the speaker feel good. This indicates a positive reaction to the sleeping pills.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise describes a negative effect (sickness) caused by the sleeping pills.
   - The Hypothesis describes a positive effect (feeling good) caused by the sleeping pills.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis describe opposite effects of the sleeping pills. If the sleeping pills made the speaker sick, they cannot simultaneously make the speaker feel good.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Final Relation Output: 2",Final Relation Output: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The sleeping pills MADE me sick.,I was sick from the sleeping pills I took.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The sleeping pills MADE me sick.""
Hypothesis: ""I was sick from the sleeping pills I took.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that the sleeping pills caused the speaker to become sick.
2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that the speaker was sick as a result of taking sleeping pills.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis discuss the same cause (sleeping pills) and the same effect (sickness).
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but maintains the same causal relationship.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the same information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""Harry SHOT Sam dead.""
   - This statement indicates that Harry killed Sam by shooting him.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""Harry hated Sam all of his life.""
   - This statement suggests that Harry had a lifelong hatred for Sam.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide definitive evidence that Harry hated Sam all of his life. The Premise only states that Harry shot Sam dead, which does not necessarily imply a lifelong hatred. There could be other reasons for the shooting.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The act of shooting someone dead could be motivated by hatred, but it could also be motivated by other factors such as self-defense, a momentary conflict, or other circumstances. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the lifelong hatred.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly opposes the idea that Harry hated Sam all of his life. The Premise does not provide any such information; it simply states the act of shooting.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Harry SHOT Sam dead.,Harry saved Sam's life.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""Harry SHOT Sam dead.""
   - This statement indicates that Harry shot Sam, resulting in Sam's death.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""Harry saved Sam's life.""
   - This statement suggests that Harry performed an action that resulted in Sam's life being saved.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Harry's action led to Sam's death.
   - The Hypothesis states that Harry's action led to Sam's life being saved.

4. **Inference**:
   - If Harry shot Sam dead, it is impossible for Harry to have saved Sam's life. The two statements are mutually exclusive because one describes an action leading to death, while the other describes an action leading to life being saved.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Harry SHOT Sam dead.,Sam died from the shot Harry took.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""Harry SHOT Sam dead.""
   - This statement indicates that Harry shot Sam and as a result, Sam died.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""Sam died from the shot Harry took.""
   - This statement suggests that Sam's death was a direct result of the shot fired by Harry.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that Harry shot Sam dead, which means Sam's death was caused by Harry's shot.
   - The Hypothesis states that Sam died from the shot Harry took, which aligns perfectly with the information given in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the information in the Premise, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct numerical value for the relation is:

Premise: Sam TALKED himself hoarse.
Hypothesis: Sam likes to talk.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise states that Sam talked so much that he became hoarse. This implies that Sam engaged in a significant amount of talking.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis suggests that Sam likes to talk. 

3. **Evaluating the Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be definitely true given the premise, the premise must provide conclusive evidence that Sam likes to talk. While the premise indicates that Sam talked a lot, it does not necessarily mean he likes to talk. He could have talked a lot out of necessity or obligation.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise shows that Sam talked a lot, which could suggest he likes to talk, but it is not definitive. There could be other reasons for his extensive talking.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the hypothesis to be false given the premise, the premise would need to indicate that Sam does not like to talk. The premise does not provide any information that contradicts the hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Sam TALKED himself hoarse.,Sam's talking made his voice clearer.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: Sam TALKED himself hoarse.
- This means that Sam talked so much or so intensely that he ended up with a hoarse voice, which typically implies a rough or strained voice.

Hypothesis: Sam's talking made his voice clearer.
- This suggests that as a result of Sam's talking, his voice became clearer, which typically implies a more distinct or easy-to-understand voice.

Now, let's compare the two statements:

1. The Premise indicates that Sam's talking resulted in a hoarse voice.
2. The Hypothesis suggests that Sam's talking resulted in a clearer voice.

These two outcomes are mutually exclusive because a hoarse voice is the opposite of a clear voice. Therefore, if Sam talked himself hoarse, it is impossible for his talking to have made his voice clearer.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Thus, the relation is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Sam TALKED himself hoarse.,Sam's voice was hoarse from talking.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""Sam TALKED himself hoarse.""
   - This means that Sam talked so much that his voice became hoarse.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""Sam's voice was hoarse from talking.""
   - This means that the reason for Sam's hoarse voice is his talking.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Sam talked himself hoarse, which directly implies that his voice became hoarse due to talking.
   - The Hypothesis states that Sam's voice was hoarse from talking, which is essentially a restatement of the cause-effect relationship described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because it directly follows from the information provided in the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.,His house was previously a darker color.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.""
   - This statement tells us that the house is now a bright shade of red because he painted it that color.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""His house was previously a darker color.""
   - This statement suggests that before the house was painted a bright shade of red, it was a darker color.

3. **Inference Relationship**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the previous color of the house. It only states the current color after painting.
   - The Hypothesis makes an assumption about the previous color, which is not supported or contradicted by the Premise.

Given that the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the Hypothesis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct relation output is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.,He scraped off the red paint from his house.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.""
   - This means that at some point, he applied red paint to his house.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""He scraped off the red paint from his house.""
   - This implies that he removed the red paint from his house.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the house was painted red.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that the red paint was removed.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If he painted his house red, it means the house had red paint on it.
   - If he scraped off the red paint, it means the house no longer has the red paint.
   - These two statements cannot both be true at the same time because one describes the application of red paint, and the other describes the removal of that paint.

Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

**Conclusion**:
The relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

**Final Answer**:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.,His house was bright red from paint.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.""
   - This indicates that the action of painting has been completed and the color used is a bright shade of red.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""His house was bright red from paint.""
   - This suggests that the house is currently bright red and the color is due to paint.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides the information that the house was painted a bright shade of red.
   - The Hypothesis states that the house is bright red because of paint.

4. **Inference**:
   - Given that the Premise confirms the house was painted a bright shade of red, it logically follows that the house is bright red from paint.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or goes beyond what is stated in the Premise.

Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

resultative,schematic,She KICKED the door open.,She needed to get into the house quickly.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""She KICKED the door open.""
   - This indicates that she used force to open the door by kicking it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""She needed to get into the house quickly.""
   - This suggests a reason or motivation for her action, implying urgency.

3. **Relation Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise must directly imply the Hypothesis. In this case, the Premise does not directly state or imply that she needed to get into the house quickly. It only states that she kicked the door open.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The action of kicking the door open could be due to needing to get into the house quickly, but it could also be due to other reasons (e.g., frustration, the door being stuck, etc.). There is no definitive link between the Premise and the Hypothesis.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise must directly contradict the Hypothesis. There is no contradiction here; the Premise does not provide any information that would make the Hypothesis impossible.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,She KICKED the door open.,She slowly opened the door.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""She KICKED the door open.""
   - This indicates a forceful and sudden action to open the door.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""She slowly opened the door.""
   - This suggests a gradual and gentle action to open the door.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a quick and forceful action (kicking).
   - The Hypothesis describes a slow and gentle action (slowly opening).

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are mutually exclusive. If she kicked the door open, it cannot be true that she slowly opened the door.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,She KICKED the door open.,The door was open from her kick.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: She KICKED the door open.
Hypothesis: The door was open from her kick.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The action described in the premise is that ""She kicked the door open."" This means that the door was initially closed, and her action of kicking caused it to become open.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis states, ""The door was open from her kick."" This implies that the door became open as a result of her kicking it.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The premise explicitly states that the door was opened by her kick.
   - The hypothesis states that the door was open as a result of her kick.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis is directly supported by the premise. The premise provides a clear cause (her kick) and effect (the door becoming open) relationship.
   - There is no additional information in the hypothesis that contradicts or goes beyond what is stated in the premise.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,She tugged at the glass door.,She had a sliding glass door to her backyard.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""She tugged at the glass door.""
   - This indicates that there is a glass door and she is pulling or trying to open it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""She had a sliding glass door to her backyard.""
   - This suggests that she possesses a sliding glass door that leads to her backyard.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not specify the type of glass door (whether it is sliding or not).
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information about the door being a sliding door and its location (leading to the backyard), which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true, the Premise must provide enough information to confirm that the door is a sliding glass door leading to the backyard. The Premise does not provide this information.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, but it also does not provide enough information to confirm it.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false, the Premise would need to provide information that directly contradicts the Hypothesis. The Premise does not do this.

Since the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the details in the Hypothesis, the relationship is Neutral.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,She tugged at the glass door.,She made no motion towards the glass door.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""She tugged at the glass door.""
   - This indicates that the subject made a physical action towards the glass door, specifically tugging at it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""She made no motion towards the glass door.""
   - This indicates that the subject did not make any physical action towards the glass door.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that there was a physical action (tugging) towards the glass door.
   - The Hypothesis states that there was no physical action towards the glass door.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If she tugged at the glass door, it is impossible that she made no motion towards it.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,She tugged at the glass door.,She attempted to tug the glass door.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""She tugged at the glass door.""
   - This statement indicates that the action of tugging at the glass door has already occurred.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""She attempted to tug the glass door.""
   - This statement suggests that there was an attempt to tug the glass door, but it does not confirm whether the action was completed.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise confirms that the action of tugging at the glass door was completed.
   - The Hypothesis only suggests an attempt to tug the glass door, which implies that the action may or may not have been completed.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise confirms the action was completed, and the Hypothesis only suggests an attempt (which is a weaker statement), the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the Hypothesis.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He tugged at the puppy's ears.,He had a puppy with long ears.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He tugged at the puppy's ears.""
   - This statement tells us that there is a puppy and someone is tugging at its ears.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""He had a puppy with long ears.""
   - This statement suggests that the person has a puppy and that the puppy has long ears.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the length of the puppy's ears. It only mentions that the person tugged at the puppy's ears.
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information (the length of the ears) that is not present in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not confirm or deny the length of the puppy's ears, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. There is no definitive information in the Premise to conclude the truth of the Hypothesis.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He tugged at the puppy's ears.,He pushed the puppy's ears.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He tugged at the puppy's ears.""
   - The action described is ""tugged,"" which implies pulling or jerking.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""He pushed the puppy's ears.""
   - The action described is ""pushed,"" which implies applying force in a different manner, typically moving something away.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The actions ""tugged"" and ""pushed"" are different in nature. ""Tugged"" involves pulling, while ""pushed"" involves applying force in the opposite direction.
   - Given the Premise, the action of tugging does not imply or entail the action of pushing. In fact, they are contradictory actions.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are contradictory, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He tugged at the puppy's ears.,The puppy's ears were tugged by him.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He tugged at the puppy's ears.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""The puppy's ears were tugged by him.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Semantic Content**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action. The Premise states that ""He tugged at the puppy's ears,"" and the Hypothesis rephrases this action in the passive voice as ""The puppy's ears were tugged by him.""
  
- **Grammatical Structure**: The Premise uses an active voice construction, while the Hypothesis uses a passive voice construction. Despite this difference in grammatical structure, the meaning conveyed by both sentences is identical.

- **Consistency**: There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or adds uncertainty to the information provided in the Premise. The action described is the same, and the agent (he) and the object (the puppy's ears) are consistent across both sentences.

### Conclusion:
Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise with no change in meaning, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.",I tried to break my door down to leave my house.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.""
Hypothesis: ""I tried to break my door down to leave my house.""

1. **Identify the actions and outcomes in the Premise:**
   - The speaker kicked at the door a couple of times.
   - The door did not budge.

2. **Identify the actions and intentions in the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker tried to break the door down.
   - The purpose was to leave the house.

3. **Compare the actions in the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The action of kicking the door in the Premise can be seen as an attempt to break it down.
   - The Hypothesis suggests an intention to leave the house, which is not explicitly mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Determine if the Hypothesis is definitely true, possibly true, or definitely false given the Premise:**
   - The Premise does not explicitly state the intention behind kicking the door, but it is reasonable to infer that kicking a door could be an attempt to break it down.
   - The Premise does not mention the speaker's location (inside or outside the house), so the intention to leave the house is not confirmed or denied.

Given these points, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. The intention to leave the house is not explicitly stated, making it a plausible but not certain inference.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.",The door swung open immediately from one kick.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.""
   - This means that despite multiple attempts to kick the door, it remained closed and did not move.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The door swung open immediately from one kick.""
   - This suggests that the door opened right away with just a single kick.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the door did not move at all even after multiple kicks.
   - The Hypothesis states that the door opened immediately with just one kick.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise. According to the Premise, the door did not budge, whereas the Hypothesis claims the door swung open immediately from one kick.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.",The door didn't budge from my multiple kicks at it.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.""
Hypothesis: ""The door didn't budge from my multiple kicks at it.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The speaker kicked the door a couple of times.
   - Despite the kicks, the door did not move or open.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The door did not move or open as a result of multiple kicks by the speaker.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The Hypothesis states that the door did not budge due to multiple kicks.
   - The Premise confirms that the speaker kicked the door a couple of times and it did not budge.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The information in the Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or goes beyond what is stated in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Relation: 0",Relation: 0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.,Henry Edison had gotten a flat on his old automobile.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.""
   - This statement describes an action where Henry Edison is kicking at the tire of an old automobile.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Henry Edison had gotten a flat on his old automobile.""
   - This statement suggests that Henry Edison experienced a flat tire on his old automobile.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state that the tire is flat; it only mentions that Henry Edison is kicking at the tire.
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information by stating that the tire is flat, which is not directly supported or contradicted by the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis must be definitely true given the Premise. In this case, the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm that the tire is flat.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The action of kicking at the tire could be related to a flat tire, but it is not necessarily so. There could be other reasons for kicking the tire.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide any information that directly contradicts the Hypothesis.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is **Neutral (1)** because the Premise does not confirm or deny the flat tire; it only describes an action that could be related to various situations.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.,Hendy Edison shined his tire on his new automobile.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.""
   - This statement describes an action performed by Henry Edison, specifically kicking a tire on an old automobile.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Hendy Edison shined his tire on his new automobile.""
   - This statement describes an action performed by Hendy Edison, specifically shining a tire on a new automobile.

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Subject**: The Premise mentions ""Henry Edison,"" while the Hypothesis mentions ""Hendy Edison."" This could be a typographical error, but for the sake of analysis, we will treat them as different individuals.
   - **Action**: The Premise describes kicking a tire, while the Hypothesis describes shining a tire. These are different actions.
   - **Object**: The Premise involves an ""old automobile,"" while the Hypothesis involves a ""new automobile."" These are different objects.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are different.
   - The subjects (Henry Edison vs. Hendy Edison) are different.
   - The objects (old automobile vs. new automobile) are different.

Given these differences, the Hypothesis cannot be inferred from the Premise. In fact, the actions and objects are contradictory.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.,Henry Edison tried to kick the tire on the old automobile.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.""
   - This statement indicates that Henry Edison performed the action of kicking at the tire on an old automobile.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Henry Edison tried to kick the tire on the old automobile.""
   - This statement suggests that Henry Edison made an attempt to kick the tire on the old automobile, but it does not confirm whether the kick was successful or not.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Henry Edison actually kicked at the tire.
   - The Hypothesis states that Henry Edison tried to kick the tire, which implies an attempt but does not confirm the action was completed.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise because trying to kick the tire could include the action of kicking at it.
   - However, the Hypothesis does not necessarily entail the Premise because trying to kick does not confirm that the kick was actually executed.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is Neutral.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.,Luke tested the durability of the chair with his shoe.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.""
   - This statement describes an action where Luke uses his leather half-boot to kick at the leg of a chair.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Luke tested the durability of the chair with his shoe.""
   - This statement suggests that Luke's action was intended to test the durability of the chair using his shoe.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise describes a specific action (kicking the chair leg with a leather half-boot).
   - The Hypothesis interprets this action as a test of the chair's durability.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state the purpose of Luke's action. It only describes the action itself.
   - The Hypothesis adds an interpretation (testing durability) that is not directly mentioned in the Premise.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis introduces additional information that is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise alone. The Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the Hypothesis.

**Conclusion**: The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is Neutral.

**Relation Output**: 1",**Relation Output**: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.,Luke pushed the chair away with his tennis shoe.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.""
Hypothesis: ""Luke pushed the chair away with his tennis shoe.""

1. **Identify the actions described in both sentences:**
   - Premise: Luke kicked at the chair leg.
   - Hypothesis: Luke pushed the chair away.

2. **Identify the footwear mentioned in both sentences:**
   - Premise: Leather half-boot.
   - Hypothesis: Tennis shoe.

3. **Compare the actions:**
   - Kicking at the chair leg (Premise) is different from pushing the chair away (Hypothesis). Kicking and pushing are distinct actions.

4. **Compare the footwear:**
   - Leather half-boot (Premise) is different from a tennis shoe (Hypothesis).

5. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The actions and the footwear described in the Hypothesis are different from those in the Premise. Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

conative,partial,Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.,The chair leg was kicked at with Luke's toe of his leather half-boot.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.
Hypothesis: The chair leg was kicked at with Luke's toe of his leather half-boot.

1. **Check for Entailment (0)**:
   - The Premise states that ""Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.""
   - The Hypothesis rephrases this as ""The chair leg was kicked at with Luke's toe of his leather half-boot.""
   - Both statements describe the same action and the same details (Luke, chair leg, toe, leather half-boot).
   - The Hypothesis is a passive rephrasing of the Premise, maintaining all the essential details.

2. **Check for Neutral (1)**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or context that is not present in the Premise.
   - There is no ambiguity or additional context that could make the Hypothesis possibly true or false beyond what is stated in the Premise.

3. **Check for Contradiction (2)**:
   - There is no information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.
   - Both statements are consistent with each other.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise with no additional or contradictory information. Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

conative,partial,He looked down and poked at the keyboard.,He was typing on his computer.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He looked down and poked at the keyboard.""
   - This statement describes an action where someone is interacting with a keyboard by poking at it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He was typing on his computer.""
   - This statement suggests that the person was engaged in the activity of typing on a computer.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions ""poked at the keyboard,"" which implies some form of interaction with the keyboard but does not explicitly state that the person was typing.
   - The Hypothesis states ""He was typing on his computer,"" which is a specific activity involving the keyboard.

4. **Inference**:
   - The action of ""poking at the keyboard"" could be part of the process of typing, but it is not definitive. Poking at the keyboard could also mean pressing random keys or interacting with the keyboard in a non-typing manner.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis ""He was typing on his computer"" is not definitively true based on the Premise alone. It is possible but not certain.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, it must be definitely true given the Premise. However, the Premise does not provide information about looking up at the screen; it only mentions looking down at the keyboard.
   - **Neutral (1)**: For the Hypothesis to be neutral, it must be possible but not certain given the Premise. The Premise does not rule out the possibility that after looking down at the keyboard, the person could look up at the screen. However, it does not provide enough information to confirm this action either.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, it must be impossible given the Premise. The Premise does not state that the person cannot look up at the screen; it only describes the current action of looking down at the keyboard.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He looked down and poked at the keyboard.,He looked down and made poking motions in the direction of the keyboard.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He looked down and poked at the keyboard.""
   - This statement describes a person looking down and performing the action of poking at the keyboard.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He looked down and made poking motions in the direction of the keyboard.""
   - This statement describes a person looking down and making poking motions towards the keyboard.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the person looking down.
   - The action described in the Premise is ""poked at the keyboard,"" which implies direct contact with the keyboard.
   - The action described in the Hypothesis is ""made poking motions in the direction of the keyboard,"" which implies the motions are directed towards the keyboard but does not necessarily confirm contact.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise because making poking motions in the direction of the keyboard could include actually poking the keyboard.
   - However, the Hypothesis does not definitively state that the person made contact with the keyboard, which is explicitly stated in the Premise.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.,Mary Elizabeth was testing the softness of the potatoes.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.""
   - This indicates that Mary Elizabeth performed two actions: she jumped up and then poked at the potatoes.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Mary Elizabeth was testing the softness of the potatoes.""
   - This suggests that Mary Elizabeth's action of poking at the potatoes was for the purpose of testing their softness.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state the reason why Mary Elizabeth poked at the potatoes. It only describes the action.
   - The Hypothesis provides a possible reason for the action (testing the softness), but this reason is not confirmed by the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise explicitly stated that Mary Elizabeth was testing the softness of the potatoes. However, the Premise does not provide this information.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The action of poking at the potatoes could be for testing their softness, but it could also be for other reasons not mentioned in the Premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise explicitly stated a different reason for poking at the potatoes. However, the Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis.

Given that the Premise does not confirm or deny the reason for poking at the potatoes, the most appropriate relation is Neutral.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.,Mary Elizabeth stared at the potatoes but made no move towards them.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.""
   - This indicates that Mary Elizabeth took an active action towards the potatoes by jumping up and poking them.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Mary Elizabeth stared at the potatoes but made no move towards them.""
   - This suggests that Mary Elizabeth did not take any action towards the potatoes; she only stared at them.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Mary Elizabeth actively interacted with the potatoes by poking them.
   - The Hypothesis states that Mary Elizabeth did not interact with the potatoes at all, only staring at them without making any move.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are mutually exclusive. If Mary Elizabeth poked at the potatoes, she must have made a move towards them, which directly contradicts the Hypothesis stating she made no move towards them.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.,The potatoes were poked at as Mary Elizabeth jumped up.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.
Hypothesis: The potatoes were poked at as Mary Elizabeth jumped up.

1. **Identify the actions and subjects in the Premise:**
   - Subject: Mary Elizabeth
   - Actions: jumped up, poked at the potatoes

2. **Identify the actions and subjects in the Hypothesis:**
   - Subject: The potatoes (passive voice)
   - Actions: were poked at (by Mary Elizabeth), as Mary Elizabeth jumped up

3. **Compare the actions and subjects:**
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the actions in the Premise but in a passive voice.
   - The sequence of actions is maintained: Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise, maintaining the same meaning.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.,I had a straw in my cold drink.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker interacted with ice cubes in their drink. It implies the presence of ice cubes and a drink.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I had a straw in my cold drink.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker had a straw in their drink, which is described as cold.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not mention anything about a straw. It only mentions poking at ice cubes.
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information about having a straw in the drink, which is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.
   - The Premise does imply that the drink is cold because it contains ice cubes, but it does not provide any information about the presence of a straw.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis must be definitely true given the Premise. This is not the case here because the Premise does not confirm the presence of a straw.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. This fits because the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the presence of a straw.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. This is not the case because the Premise does not contradict the presence of a straw.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.,I left the ice cubes in my drink alone.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker interacted with the ice cubes by poking at them.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I left the ice cubes in my drink alone.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker did not interact with the ice cubes and left them untouched.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker poked at the ice cubes, which is a form of interaction.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker left the ice cubes alone, which means no interaction occurred.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are mutually exclusive. If the speaker poked at the ice cubes, they did not leave them alone.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final output:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.,I moved around ice cubes in my drink.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.""
   - This statement describes an action where the speaker is interacting with the ice cubes in their drink by poking at them.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I moved around ice cubes in my drink.""
   - This statement describes an action where the speaker is moving the ice cubes around in their drink.

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Similarity**: Both statements involve the speaker interacting with the ice cubes in their drink.
   - **Action Detail**: The Premise specifies the action as ""poked at,"" which implies some movement of the ice cubes, though it is not explicitly stated as ""moving around."" The Hypothesis generalizes this action to ""moved around,"" which can be seen as a broader description that includes poking as a possible way to move the ice cubes.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the action described in the Premise must necessarily imply the action described in the Hypothesis. Poking at ice cubes can be considered a way of moving them around, so the Hypothesis can be seen as a generalization of the Premise.
   - **Neutral (1)**: If the Hypothesis could be true but is not necessarily implied by the Premise, it would be neutral. However, in this case, poking at ice cubes does imply some movement.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: If the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise, it would be a contradiction. This is not the case here, as poking at ice cubes does not contradict moving them around.

Given that poking at ice cubes can be considered a specific way of moving them around, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.,Marco had been up very high on a ladder.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.""
   - This statement tells us that Marco was on a ladder and lost his balance, prompting him to grab the railing.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Marco had been up very high on a ladder.""
   - This statement suggests that Marco was at a significant height on the ladder.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not specify the height at which Marco was on the ladder. It only mentions that he lost his balance and grabbed the railing.
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information by stating that Marco was ""very high"" on the ladder, which is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide any information about the height of the ladder, we cannot definitively conclude that Marco was ""very high"" on the ladder.
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as the height is not specified.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.,Marco maintained balance and didn't need the ladder railing.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.""
   - This indicates that Marco was in a situation where he lost his balance and, as a result, he grabbed the ladder railing to possibly steady himself.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Marco maintained balance and didn't need the ladder railing.""
   - This suggests that Marco did not lose his balance and therefore did not need to grab the ladder railing.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Marco lost his balance and grabbed the ladder railing.
   - The Hypothesis states that Marco maintained his balance and did not need the ladder railing.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise says Marco lost his balance and grabbed the railing, while the Hypothesis says he maintained his balance and did not need the railing.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.,Marco grabbed at the ladder railing as he lost his balance.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.""
   - This sentence describes two actions: Marco losing his balance and then grabbing at the ladder railing.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Marco grabbed at the ladder railing as he lost his balance.""
   - This sentence describes Marco grabbing at the ladder railing while he was losing his balance.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same two actions: Marco losing his balance and grabbing at the ladder railing.
   - The sequence of actions in the Premise is that Marco first lost his balance and then grabbed at the ladder railing.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that Marco grabbed at the ladder railing simultaneously as he was losing his balance.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it is plausible that Marco grabbed the railing as he was losing his balance.
   - The Hypothesis is not definitively true based on the Premise alone because the Premise specifies a sequence (first losing balance, then grabbing the railing), while the Hypothesis suggests simultaneity.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.,I tried to fix the springs in the toy.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.""
   - This action involves physically interacting with springs using the palms of the hands.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I tried to fix the springs in the toy.""
   - This statement suggests an attempt to repair or adjust springs that are part of a toy.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a specific action (pushing at the springs) but does not provide any information about the purpose or context of this action.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a purpose (trying to fix the springs) and specifies that the springs are part of a toy, which is additional information not present in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise would need to explicitly indicate that the action of pushing at the springs was an attempt to fix them in a toy. This is not the case here.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The action of pushing at the springs could be part of an attempt to fix them, but it could also be for another reason entirely. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the Hypothesis.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise explicitly stated something that contradicts the idea of fixing springs in a toy. However, there is no such contradiction present in the Premise.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is Neutral (1), as the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the Hypothesis.

**Relation Output**: 1",**Relation Output**: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.,I released the springs with the tips of my fingers.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.""
   - This indicates an action where the subject is applying force to the springs using the palms of their hands.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I released the springs with the tips of my fingers.""
   - This indicates a different action where the subject is releasing the springs using the tips of their fingers.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are different: pushing vs. releasing.
   - The body parts used in the actions are also different: palms of hands vs. tips of fingers.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis describes an action that is not only different from the action in the Premise but also involves different parts of the hands.
   - Given the Premise, the action described in the Hypothesis cannot be true because it contradicts the action and the body parts used in the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final Relation Output: 2",Final Relation Output: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.,I pushed the palms of my hands against the springs.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.""
   - This sentence describes an action where the speaker is using the palms of their hands to push against the springs.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I pushed the palms of my hands against the springs.""
   - This sentence also describes an action where the speaker is using the palms of their hands to push against the springs.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both sentences describe the same action: pushing the springs with the palms of the hands.
   - The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is identical.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they describe the same action in different words), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.,His belly pushed at the buttons of the hotel elevator through his shirt.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.""
   - This sentence describes a situation where a person's belly is pressing against the buttons of their shirt, which is specifically described as a white and blue Aloha shirt.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""His belly pushed at the buttons of the hotel elevator through his shirt.""
   - This sentence describes a situation where a person's belly is pressing against the buttons of a hotel elevator, and this action is happening through his shirt.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about the belly pushing at the buttons of the shirt itself.
   - The Hypothesis talks about the belly pushing at the buttons of a hotel elevator through the shirt.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not mention anything about a hotel elevator or the belly pushing elevator buttons.
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information (hotel elevator buttons) that is not present in the Premise.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the action described in the Hypothesis.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.,The white and blue Aloha shirt hung on his thin frame.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.""
   - This indicates that the person has a belly that is large enough to push against the buttons of the shirt, suggesting that the shirt is tight on him.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The white and blue Aloha shirt hung on his thin frame.""
   - This suggests that the shirt is loose and hanging on a thin frame, implying that the person is thin.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a situation where the shirt is tight because of a large belly.
   - The Hypothesis describes a situation where the shirt is loose because of a thin frame.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The two descriptions are contradictory. If the shirt is tight due to a large belly, it cannot simultaneously be loose and hanging on a thin frame.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.,The white and blue Aloha shirt buttons stretched over his belly.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.""
   - This indicates that the person's belly is exerting pressure on the buttons of the shirt, suggesting that the shirt is tight around the belly area.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The white and blue Aloha shirt buttons stretched over his belly.""
   - This suggests that the buttons of the shirt are being stretched due to the pressure from the belly, implying that the shirt is tight around the belly area.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a situation where the shirt is tight around the belly, causing the buttons to be under pressure or stretched.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with a focus on the buttons being stretched due to the belly pushing against them.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (both describe the same situation with slightly different wording), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He pushed at the doorbell.,He wanted to see if someone was home.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He pushed at the doorbell.""
   - This statement describes an action where a person is pushing the doorbell.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""He wanted to see if someone was home.""
   - This statement suggests a possible motivation for the action described in the premise.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be definitely true given the premise, the action of pushing the doorbell must unequivocally indicate the desire to see if someone is home. However, pushing a doorbell could have other motivations (e.g., delivering a package, playing a prank, etc.).
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The action of pushing the doorbell could indeed be because the person wants to see if someone is home, but it is not the only possible reason.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The hypothesis cannot be true given the premise. This would be the case if the premise explicitly indicated a different motivation for pushing the doorbell, which it does not.

Given that the premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the hypothesis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He pushed at the doorbell.,He hovered over the doorbell.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He pushed at the doorbell.""
   - This indicates that the subject (he) applied force to the doorbell, likely pressing it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""He hovered over the doorbell.""
   - This suggests that the subject (he) was positioned above or near the doorbell without making contact or pressing it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The action described in the Premise (pushing the doorbell) involves physical contact and exertion of force.
   - The action described in the Hypothesis (hovering over the doorbell) implies no physical contact or pressing.

4. **Inference**:
   - Since pushing the doorbell and hovering over the doorbell are mutually exclusive actions (one involves contact and the other does not), the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Final Relation Output: 2",Final Relation Output: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He pushed at the doorbell.,The doorbell was pushed at by him.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""He pushed at the doorbell.""
2. **Hypothesis:** ""The doorbell was pushed at by him.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Semantic Content:** Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action: a person (he) pushing at the doorbell.
- **Paraphrasing:** The Hypothesis is a passive voice construction of the active voice Premise. The meaning remains unchanged.
- **Consistency:** There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or adds uncertainty to the Premise. The action described is identical in both statements.

### Conclusion:

Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise with no change in meaning, it is definitely true given the Premise.

**Relation Output:** 0",**Relation Output:** 0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.",I had a mark on my body I needed to wash off.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.""
   - This indicates that the speaker used a washcloth, made it wet, and then rubbed it on a mark.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I had a mark on my body I needed to wash off.""
   - This suggests that the speaker had a mark on their body that they intended to clean.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not specify where the mark is located. It only mentions that the speaker rubbed at a mark with a wet washcloth.
   - The Hypothesis specifically states that the mark is on the speaker's body and that they needed to wash it off.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm that the mark is on the speaker's body. The mark could be on any surface, not necessarily the body.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. There is no direct contradiction, but there is also no definitive support for the Hypothesis based on the information provided in the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.",I took a dry washcloth and hovered over the mark.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.""
   - This indicates that the washcloth was wet and used to rub at a mark.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I took a dry washcloth and hovered over the mark.""
   - This indicates that the washcloth was dry and was not used to rub the mark but rather hovered over it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the washcloth was wet, while the Hypothesis states that the washcloth was dry. This is a direct contradiction.
   - The Premise states that the washcloth was used to rub at the mark, while the Hypothesis states that the washcloth was hovered over the mark. This is another direct contradiction.

Given these points, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because the conditions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict those in the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.",I rubbed at the mark with a wet washcloth.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.""
   - This statement describes a sequence of actions: first, taking a washcloth, then wetting it, and finally rubbing at a mark.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I rubbed at the mark with a wet washcloth.""
   - This statement describes the action of rubbing at a mark using a wet washcloth.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis states that the action of rubbing at the mark was done with a wet washcloth.
   - The Premise provides a detailed sequence leading to the same action: taking a washcloth, wetting it, and then rubbing at the mark.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is a simplified version of the final action described in the Premise.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because the Premise explicitly states that the washcloth was wet before rubbing at the mark.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.,He had a fresh bite on his neck.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.""
   - This indicates that there is a bite wound on his throat.
   - The wound is described as ""raw,"" which suggests it is fresh or not fully healed.
   - The action of rubbing implies that the wound is causing some discomfort or irritation.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""He had a fresh bite on his neck.""
   - This suggests that there is a fresh bite on his neck.
   - The term ""fresh"" implies that the bite is recent.
   - The location specified is ""neck,"" which is anatomically close to the ""throat.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions a ""raw bite wound on his throat,"" which aligns with the Hypothesis stating ""a fresh bite on his neck.""
   - The terms ""raw"" and ""fresh"" are synonymous in this context, both indicating a recent wound.
   - The throat is part of the neck, so the locations are consistent.

4. **Inference**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because the description of the wound in the Premise supports the statement in the Hypothesis.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

conative,partial,He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.,His rubbing came nowhere close to the raw bite wound on his throat.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.""
   - This indicates that there is a raw bite wound on his throat and he is rubbing it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""His rubbing came nowhere close to the raw bite wound on his throat.""
   - This suggests that his rubbing did not touch or come near the raw bite wound on his throat.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise clearly states that he is rubbing the raw bite wound on his throat.
   - The Hypothesis claims that his rubbing did not come close to the raw bite wound on his throat.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise says he is rubbing the wound, while the Hypothesis says his rubbing did not come close to the wound.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.,His throat had a raw bite wound he rubbed at.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.""
Hypothesis: ""His throat had a raw bite wound he rubbed at.""

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.""
   - The Hypothesis states that ""His throat had a raw bite wound he rubbed at.""

2. **Paraphrasing Check**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. Both sentences convey the same information: there is a raw bite wound on his throat, and he is rubbing it.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise. It simply restates the same fact in a different order.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (it is a direct rephrasing), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I rubbed at the ache in my neck.,I slept on my neck wrong.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I rubbed at the ache in my neck.""
   - This indicates that the speaker is experiencing some discomfort or pain in their neck and is trying to alleviate it by rubbing.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I slept on my neck wrong.""
   - This suggests a possible cause for the neck ache, implying that the discomfort might be due to an improper sleeping position.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must definitively imply the Hypothesis. In this case, the Premise does not definitively state the cause of the neck ache; it only mentions the action of rubbing the ache.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the cause of the neck ache. It is possible that the neck ache is due to sleeping wrong, but it is also possible that it could be due to other reasons (e.g., poor posture, injury, etc.).
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must make the Hypothesis impossible. The Premise does not provide any information that would make the Hypothesis impossible.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is **Neutral (1)** because the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the cause of the neck ache.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I rubbed at the ache in my neck.,I didn't touch my alleviated neck.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I rubbed at the ache in my neck.""
   - This indicates that the speaker performed an action (rubbing) on their neck, which was aching.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I didn't touch my alleviated neck.""
   - This indicates that the speaker did not touch their neck, which is described as alleviated (implying it no longer aches).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an action (rubbing) that involves touching the neck.
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states that the speaker did not touch their neck.
   - These two statements are directly contradictory because the Premise involves touching the neck, while the Hypothesis denies any touching of the neck.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the Premise and Hypothesis present mutually exclusive actions (touching vs. not touching), the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final output:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,I rubbed at the ache in my neck.,I had an ache in my neck I rubbed at.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: ""I rubbed at the ache in my neck.""
Hypothesis: ""I had an ache in my neck I rubbed at.""

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker rubbed at an ache located in their neck.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker had an ache in their neck and they rubbed at it.

2. **Information Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention an ache in the neck.
   - Both statements indicate that the speaker rubbed at this ache.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. It does not introduce any new information or contradict the information given in the Premise.
   - The action described (rubbing at the ache) and the location of the ache (in the neck) are consistent between the Premise and the Hypothesis.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - Since the Hypothesis restates the information provided in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details, it can be concluded that the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

conative,partial,Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.,Lily was wearing a decorated dress.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.""
   - This indicates that Lily's dress has ribbons on it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Lily was wearing a decorated dress.""
   - This suggests that Lily's dress has some form of decoration.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions that there are ribbons on Lily's dress.
   - Ribbons are a form of decoration.

4. **Inference**:
   - If Lily's dress has ribbons, it can be inferred that her dress is decorated (since ribbons are decorative elements).
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.,Lily made no attempt to touch the ribbons on her dress.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.""
   - This statement indicates that Lily interacted with the ribbons on her dress by plucking at them.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Lily made no attempt to touch the ribbons on her dress.""
   - This statement suggests that Lily did not try to touch the ribbons on her dress at all.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Lily did touch the ribbons (by plucking at them).
   - The Hypothesis states that Lily did not touch the ribbons (made no attempt to touch them).

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If Lily plucked at the ribbons, she must have touched them, which means she did make an attempt to touch them.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.,There were ribbons on Lily's dress she plucked at.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.
Hypothesis: There were ribbons on Lily's dress she plucked at.

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - Subject: Lily
   - Action: plucked
   - Object: ribbons on her dress

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - Subject: Lily
   - Action: plucked
   - Object: ribbons on her dress

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention Lily.
   - Both statements involve the action of plucking.
   - Both statements specify the object as ribbons on Lily's dress.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a restatement of the Premise, confirming the same facts.

Given that the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the information provided in the Premise, the relationship is one of **Entailment**.

Therefore, the correct relation output is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He stabbed at the last part of the equation.,The last part of the equation was the most complex.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He stabbed at the last part of the equation.""
   - This suggests that he made an attempt or effort to solve or address the last part of the equation. The word ""stabbed"" implies a possibly hurried or forceful action, but it does not provide any information about the complexity of the equation.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The last part of the equation was the most complex.""
   - This statement asserts that the last part of the equation is the most complex part of the entire equation.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the complexity of the last part of the equation. It only indicates that he made an effort to address it.
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information by claiming that the last part of the equation is the most complex, which is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide enough information to determine whether the last part of the equation is the most complex, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the given Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He stabbed at the last part of the equation.,He drew attention away from the last part of the equation.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He stabbed at the last part of the equation.""
   - This suggests that he made an effort to address or solve the last part of the equation, possibly with some intensity or focus.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He drew attention away from the last part of the equation.""
   - This suggests that he diverted focus or attention away from the last part of the equation.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are fundamentally different. The Premise indicates an action of focusing on the last part of the equation, while the Hypothesis indicates an action of diverting attention away from it.
   - These actions are mutually exclusive; one cannot both focus on and divert attention away from the same part of the equation simultaneously.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He stabbed at the last part of the equation.,He made a stabbing gesture towards the last part of the equation.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He stabbed at the last part of the equation.""
   - This suggests that he made a stabbing motion or gesture towards the last part of the equation. The word ""stabbed"" is used metaphorically here to indicate a forceful or pointed action.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He made a stabbing gesture towards the last part of the equation.""
   - This explicitly states that he made a stabbing gesture towards the last part of the equation.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis are essentially describing the same action. The Premise uses the phrase ""stabbed at,"" which can be interpreted as making a stabbing gesture. The Hypothesis clarifies this by explicitly stating ""made a stabbing gesture.""

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a more explicit restatement of the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.,I tried to drink the last bits of the slushee with my straw.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.""
   - This indicates that the speaker removed the plastic dome from their drink and then used the straw to stab at the slush inside the drink.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I tried to drink the last bits of the slushee with my straw.""
   - This suggests that the speaker attempted to consume the remaining parts of the slushee using a straw.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The action of ""stabbing at the slush with the straw"" in the Premise can be interpreted as an attempt to drink the slush, which aligns with the action described in the Hypothesis.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a plausible explanation of the actions described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is not definitively true based on the Premise alone, as the Premise does not explicitly state the intention to drink the slush, but it is a reasonable interpretation.
   - Therefore, the relationship is not one of Entailment (0).
   - The Hypothesis is also not contradicted by the Premise, so it is not a Contradiction (2).

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relationship is Neutral (1).

**Final Answer**:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.,I kept the lid on my drink and slurped the slush with my straw.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.""
   - This indicates that the speaker removed the lid (plastic dome) from their drink and then used the straw to stab at the slush.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I kept the lid on my drink and slurped the slush with my straw.""
   - This suggests that the speaker did not remove the lid and instead used the straw to slurp the slush.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the lid was removed (""took the plastic dome from my drink""), while the Hypothesis states that the lid was kept on (""kept the lid on my drink"").
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are different: ""stabbed at the slush"" vs. ""slurped the slush.""

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise because it states the opposite action regarding the lid (kept on vs. taken off).
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.,I stabbed at the slush with the straw after I took the lid off my drink.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.""
Hypothesis: ""I stabbed at the slush with the straw after I took the lid off my drink.""

1. **Identify the actions in the Premise:**
   - Action 1: ""I took the plastic dome from my drink.""
   - Action 2: ""I stabbed at the slush with the straw.""

2. **Identify the actions in the Hypothesis:**
   - Action 1: ""I took the lid off my drink.""
   - Action 2: ""I stabbed at the slush with the straw.""

3. **Compare the actions and their order:**
   - The Premise states that the plastic dome (which can be considered a lid) was taken off first, and then the slush was stabbed with the straw.
   - The Hypothesis states that the lid was taken off first, and then the slush was stabbed with the straw.

4. **Check for consistency:**
   - The actions and their order in the Hypothesis are consistent with the actions and their order in the Premise. The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but does not introduce any new information or contradictions.

5. **Determine the relationship:**
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.","She enjoyed a cup of hot coffee, as it warmed her face and hands.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.""
   - This indicates that the person is drinking coffee and seems to be enjoying it, as suggested by the actions of closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She enjoyed a cup of hot coffee, as it warmed her face and hands.""
   - This suggests that the person is enjoying the coffee and that it is hot, warming her face and hands.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes actions that imply enjoyment (sipping, closing eyes, breathing in steam), which aligns with the Hypothesis stating she enjoyed the coffee.
   - The Premise does not explicitly mention the coffee being hot or warming her face and hands, but it does imply warmth through the mention of steam.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is not definitively true based on the Premise alone because the Premise does not explicitly state that the coffee is hot or that it warmed her face and hands.
   - However, the Hypothesis is plausible given the Premise, as the actions described in the Premise suggest enjoyment and the presence of steam implies the coffee is likely hot.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise, making the relationship **Neutral**.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.","She took the cold cup and didn't drink it, realizing her coffee was cold.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.""
   - Key points: She took the cup, sipped the coffee, closed her eyes, and breathed in the steam. This implies the coffee is hot or at least warm enough to produce steam.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She took the cold cup and didn't drink it, realizing her coffee was cold.""
   - Key points: She took a cold cup, did not drink the coffee, and realized it was cold.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the coffee was hot or warm (since she sipped it and there was steam).
   - The Hypothesis states that the coffee was cold, and she did not drink it.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise suggests the coffee was hot or warm, while the Hypothesis claims it was cold and undrinkable.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.","She took the cup and closed her eyes, as she breathed in the steam of her cup of coffee she was sipping.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.""
Hypothesis: ""She took the cup and closed her eyes, as she breathed in the steam of her cup of coffee she was sipping.""

1. **Content Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that she took the cup.
   - Both mention that she sipped at the coffee.
   - Both mention that she closed her eyes.
   - Both mention that she breathed in the steam.

2. **Order and Detail**:
   - The Premise states the actions in the order: took the cup, sipped at the coffee, closed her eyes, and breathed in the steam.
   - The Hypothesis states the actions in a slightly different order but conveys the same sequence of events: took the cup, closed her eyes, breathed in the steam, and sipped at the coffee.

3. **Paraphrasing**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a paraphrase of the Premise. It rephrases the actions but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.

4. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise. There is no information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise, nor is there any additional information that would make the Hypothesis uncertain.

Given these points, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I sipped at the Heineken.,I had a bottle of beer.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I sipped at the Heineken.""
Hypothesis: ""I had a bottle of beer.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The speaker mentions sipping at a Heineken, which is a brand of beer.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The speaker claims to have a bottle of beer.

3. **Checking for Entailment**:
   - If the speaker sipped at a Heineken, it implies that they had a Heineken beer. However, the Hypothesis only states ""a bottle of beer"" without specifying the brand.
   - Since Heineken is a type of beer, having a Heineken would mean having a beer, but the Hypothesis does not specify the form (bottle, can, etc.).

4. **Checking for Contradiction**:
   - There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the Hypothesis. The Premise does not state that the beer was not in a bottle.

5. **Checking for Neutrality**:
   - The Hypothesis is more general than the Premise. The Premise specifies a Heineken, while the Hypothesis only mentions a bottle of beer. The Hypothesis could be true if the Heineken was in a bottle, but it is not necessarily true because the form of the Heineken (bottle, can, etc.) is not specified in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is Neutral.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I sipped at the Heineken.,I spit out the Heineken.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""I sipped at the Heineken.""
   - This indicates that the speaker took a small drink of the Heineken.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I spit out the Heineken.""
   - This indicates that the speaker expelled the Heineken from their mouth.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The act of sipping (taking a small drink) and spitting out (expelling the drink) are contradictory actions. If someone sips a drink, it implies they are ingesting it, at least momentarily. Spitting it out implies rejection or expulsion of the drink.

4. **Inference**:
   - Given the Premise that the speaker sipped the Heineken, it is not possible for the Hypothesis (that the speaker spit out the Heineken) to be true simultaneously. These actions are mutually exclusive.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final Relation Output: 2",Final Relation Output: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,I sipped at the Heineken.,I had some Heineken.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""I sipped at the Heineken.""
2. **Hypothesis:** ""I had some Heineken.""

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

- **Premise Analysis:** The action described in the premise is ""sipped at the Heineken,"" which implies that the speaker took a small amount of Heineken.
- **Hypothesis Analysis:** The hypothesis states ""I had some Heineken,"" which means the speaker consumed some amount of Heineken.

**Inference Relation:**

- **Entailment (0):** For the hypothesis to be definitely true given the premise, the premise must provide sufficient information to confirm the hypothesis without any doubt. In this case, if someone sips at a Heineken, it logically follows that they have had some Heineken. Therefore, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.
- **Neutral (1):** This would be the case if the hypothesis could be true or false based on the premise, but the premise does not provide enough information to confirm it definitively. However, in this case, the act of sipping directly implies having some of the drink.
- **Contradiction (2):** This would be the case if the hypothesis cannot be true given the premise. Here, there is no contradiction because sipping at the Heineken means having some of it.

Given the analysis, the hypothesis ""I had some Heineken"" is definitely true given the premise ""I sipped at the Heineken.""

**Final Decision:**

conative,partial,He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.,He toasted together with everyone using glasses of champagne.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.""
   - This indicates that the subject (he) participated in an activity involving raising a glass and sipping champagne in the company of others.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He toasted together with everyone using glasses of champagne.""
   - This suggests that the subject (he) participated in a toast with others, and the toast involved glasses of champagne.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a social activity involving champagne and a group of people.
   - The act of raising a glass and sipping champagne can be reasonably interpreted as part of a toast.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new elements that contradict the Premise. Instead, it provides a plausible interpretation of the activity described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given that the Hypothesis is a reasonable interpretation of the Premise and does not introduce any contradictory information, it can be considered as definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.,He lowered his glass and didn't sip the champagne with everyone else.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.""
   - This indicates that the subject (he) participated in a toast or a similar activity by raising his glass and sipping champagne along with others.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He lowered his glass and didn't sip the champagne with everyone else.""
   - This suggests that the subject (he) did the opposite of what is described in the premise: he lowered his glass and refrained from sipping champagne, contrary to the actions of others.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict the actions described in the Premise.
   - In the Premise, he raised his glass and sipped champagne.
   - In the Hypothesis, he lowered his glass and did not sip champagne.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis describes actions that are the opposite of those in the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.,"With everyone else, he tasted the champagne and raised his glass.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.""
   - This indicates that the subject (he) performed two actions: raising his glass and sipping champagne, and these actions were done in the company of others.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""With everyone else, he tasted the champagne and raised his glass.""
   - This indicates that the subject (he) performed two actions: tasting the champagne and raising his glass, and these actions were done in the company of others.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same actions (raising the glass and sipping/tasting champagne) and the same context (with everyone else).
   - The order of actions is slightly different, but the meaning remains the same. The actions of raising the glass and sipping/tasting champagne are interchangeable in this context without changing the overall meaning.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, despite the slight reordering of actions, the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Phil nibbled at the cake.,Phil was too full for cake.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""Phil nibbled at the cake.""
   - This indicates that Phil ate a small amount of cake.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""Phil was too full for cake.""
   - This suggests that Phil did not eat the cake because he was already full.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Phil ate a small amount of cake.
   - The Hypothesis states that Phil did not eat the cake because he was too full.

4. **Inference**:
   - If Phil nibbled at the cake, it implies that he did eat some cake, even if it was just a small amount.
   - The Hypothesis claims that Phil was too full to eat any cake, which directly contradicts the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

The correct relation output is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Phil nibbled at the cake.,Phil didn't try the cake.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""Phil nibbled at the cake.""
   - This means that Phil ate a small amount of the cake.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""Phil didn't try the cake.""
   - This means that Phil did not eat any of the cake.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise states that Phil nibbled at the cake, which implies that he did try the cake, even if it was just a small amount.
   - The Hypothesis states that Phil didn't try the cake, which directly contradicts the information given in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise, the relationship between the two statements is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value for the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Phil nibbled at the cake.,Phil ate some cake.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""Phil nibbled at the cake.""
   - This indicates that Phil took small bites of the cake. It implies that he consumed at least a small portion of the cake.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""Phil ate some cake.""
   - This statement suggests that Phil consumed a portion of the cake, but it does not specify the amount or manner of consumption.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The act of nibbling at the cake (Premise) inherently involves eating some part of the cake, even if it is a small amount.
   - The Hypothesis states that Phil ate some cake, which is consistent with the idea of nibbling.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since nibbling at the cake means eating at least a small amount of it, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.",He didn't realize how hungry he was for food.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.""
   - This indicates that the person initially ate the filet slowly or cautiously (nibbled) and then proceeded to eat it with great enthusiasm or hunger (ravenously).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He didn't realize how hungry he was for food.""
   - This suggests that the person was unaware of their own hunger until they started eating.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise directly implies it.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise contradicts it.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The Premise describes a change in eating behavior from nibbling to eating ravenously, which can imply that the person might not have realized how hungry they were initially.
   - The Hypothesis suggests a reason for the change in eating behavior, which is consistent with the Premise but not directly stated.
   - The Premise does not explicitly confirm or deny the Hypothesis; it only describes the eating behavior.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is plausible based on the Premise but is not definitively confirmed or contradicted by it.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.","He took big bites of the filet, then slowed down.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.""
Hypothesis: ""He took big bites of the filet, then slowed down.""

1. **Compare Actions:**
   - Premise: The subject starts by nibbling (small bites) and then eats ravenously (very eagerly and quickly).
   - Hypothesis: The subject starts by taking big bites (large bites) and then slows down (eats more slowly).

2. **Sequence of Actions:**
   - Premise: The sequence is nibbling (small bites) followed by ravenous eating (fast and eager).
   - Hypothesis: The sequence is big bites (large bites) followed by slowing down (eating more slowly).

3. **Consistency Check:**
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis are not consistent with those in the Premise. The Premise describes a progression from small bites to fast, eager eating, while the Hypothesis describes a progression from large bites to slower eating.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - Since the actions and their sequences in the Hypothesis contradict those in the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.","He ate ravenously, after small bites of the filet.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.""
   - This indicates that the subject first took small bites of the filet and then proceeded to eat it with great enthusiasm.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He ate ravenously, after small bites of the filet.""
   - This suggests that the subject ate ravenously following small bites of the filet.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of actions: small bites followed by ravenous eating.
   - The order of actions in the Hypothesis matches the order described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and conveys the same sequence of events, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.","She had worn lipstick that day, not knowing she would be kissed.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.""
   - This indicates that a man kissed a woman, and after the kiss, he noticed and brushed off the lipstick she had left on him.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She had worn lipstick that day, not knowing she would be kissed.""
   - This suggests that the woman wore lipstick on that particular day without the expectation of being kissed.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise confirms that the woman had lipstick on because the man brushed it off after the kiss.
   - The Hypothesis adds an additional detail that she did not know she would be kissed when she wore the lipstick.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the woman's knowledge or expectations regarding being kissed.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new element (her not knowing she would be kissed) that is not addressed in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. The Premise does not confirm or deny the woman's knowledge about being kissed.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.",He didn't touch her because of the lipstick she had that would smear on him.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.""
   - This indicates that he did kiss her and then took action to remove the lipstick she left on him.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He didn't touch her because of the lipstick she had that would smear on him.""
   - This suggests that he avoided touching her due to the presence of lipstick that could smear on him.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that he did kiss her, which implies physical contact.
   - The Hypothesis states that he didn't touch her, which directly contradicts the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the action described in the Premise, the relationship between the two is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.","He wiped at the lipstick he knew she had left behind, after he had kissed her in return.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.""
Hypothesis: ""He wiped at the lipstick he knew she had left behind, after he had kissed her in return.""

1. **Identify the actions and their sequence in the Premise:**
   - Action 1: He kissed her in return.
   - Action 2: He brushed at the lipstick she had left behind.

2. **Identify the actions and their sequence in the Hypothesis:**
   - Action 1: He kissed her in return.
   - Action 2: He wiped at the lipstick she had left behind.

3. **Compare the actions and their sequence:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of actions: kissing her in return followed by addressing the lipstick she left behind.
   - The difference in wording (""brushed"" vs. ""wiped"") does not change the overall meaning or sequence of events.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis restates the actions and their sequence described in the Premise with slightly different wording.
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because it accurately reflects the same events.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.",She had long hair past her shoulders that he moved away.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.""
   - This indicates that he observed her face and then moved some hair that was falling over her shoulders.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She had long hair past her shoulders that he moved away.""
   - This suggests that she had long hair that extended past her shoulders, and he moved it away.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions that he brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders, which implies that her hair was long enough to fall over her shoulders.
   - The Hypothesis states that she had long hair past her shoulders, which is consistent with the description in the Premise.
   - The action of moving the hair away in the Hypothesis aligns with the action of brushing at the hair in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because the details about the hair and the action of moving it are consistent and directly supported by the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.",He didn't look her in the face or touch her hair that tumbled over her shoulders.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He studied her face"" indicates that he looked at her face.
   - ""brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders"" indicates that he touched her hair.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He didn't look her in the face"" directly contradicts ""He studied her face"" from the Premise.
   - ""or touch her hair that tumbled over her shoulders"" directly contradicts ""brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders"" from the Premise.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis states that he did not perform actions (looking at her face and touching her hair) that the Premise explicitly states he did.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.","As he studied her face, he made a brushing movement at the hair tumbling over her shoulders.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.""
Hypothesis: ""As he studied her face, he made a brushing movement at the hair tumbling over her shoulders.""

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The Premise describes two actions: studying her face and brushing at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases these actions, stating that as he studied her face, he made a brushing movement at the hair tumbling over her shoulders.

2. **Action Consistency**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis mention the action of studying her face.
   - Both also mention the action of brushing at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.

3. **Temporal and Causal Consistency**:
   - The Hypothesis uses ""As he studied her face,"" which implies simultaneity with the action of brushing the hair.
   - The Premise does not explicitly state the simultaneity but implies a sequence of actions.

4. **Paraphrasing Check**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a paraphrase of the Premise, maintaining the same meaning and sequence of actions.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it can be concluded that the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Someone hammered at the front door.,Someone was trying to get in the house.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Someone hammered at the front door.""
   - This statement describes an action where someone is forcefully knocking or hitting the front door.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Someone was trying to get in the house.""
   - This statement suggests that the person hammering at the door had the intention of entering the house.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The action of hammering at the front door could imply that the person is trying to get attention or trying to enter the house. However, it is not explicitly stated in the premise that the person is trying to get in the house. The premise only mentions the action of hammering, not the intention behind it.
   - Therefore, while it is plausible that someone hammering at the door might be trying to get in, it is not a definite conclusion that can be drawn solely from the given premise.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. There is no definitive evidence in the Premise to confirm or deny the Hypothesis.

Based on this analysis, the appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Someone hammered at the front door.,Someone didn't touch the front door.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Someone hammered at the front door.""
   - This indicates that an individual made forceful contact with the front door, likely using a hammering motion.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Someone didn't touch the front door.""
   - This suggests that no one made any contact with the front door.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that there was contact with the front door (hammering).
   - The Hypothesis states that there was no contact with the front door.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If someone hammered at the front door, it is impossible for it to be true that no one touched the front door.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Someone hammered at the front door.,The front door was hammered by someone.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Someone hammered at the front door.""
   - This sentence indicates that an unspecified person performed the action of hammering on the front door.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The front door was hammered by someone.""
   - This sentence is a passive construction of the action described in the premise. It indicates that the front door received the action of being hammered by an unspecified person.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise in the passive voice. Both sentences convey the same event: an unspecified person hammering at the front door.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise and conveys the same information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,"We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.",Charles Powell is a spokesman who is speaking on the behalf of others.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.""
   - This indicates that Charles Powell is making a statement about not wanting anyone to be overlooked or neglected.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Charles Powell is a spokesman who is speaking on the behalf of others.""
   - This suggests that Charles Powell is acting in a representative capacity, speaking for a group or organization.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise explicitly mentions that Charles Powell is a spokesman.
   - The hypothesis infers that Charles Powell is speaking on behalf of others, which is a reasonable assumption given the role of a spokesman.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the premise.
   - The hypothesis is a logical extension of the premise, as it is reasonable to infer that a spokesman would be speaking on behalf of others.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,"We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.","We want people to slip through the cracks,  spokesman Charles Powell said.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.""
   - This indicates a desire to prevent people from being overlooked or neglected.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""We want people to slip through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.""
   - This suggests a desire for people to be overlooked or neglected.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise explicitly states a negative intention (""don't want anyone to slip through the cracks"").
   - The hypothesis states the opposite intention (""want people to slip through the cracks"").

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. The premise indicates a desire to prevent something, while the hypothesis indicates a desire for that very thing to happen.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.","Spokesman Charles Powell had said, ""We don't want anyone to slip through the cracks.""",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.""
   - This indicates that Charles Powell, who is a spokesman, made a statement expressing a desire to prevent people from slipping through the cracks.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Spokesman Charles Powell had said, 'We don't want anyone to slip through the cracks.'""
   - This is a direct quotation of what Charles Powell said, with the only difference being the use of quotation marks and the word ""had"" instead of ""said.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The content of the Hypothesis is essentially a rephrased version of the Premise with no change in meaning.
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same information: Charles Powell, the spokesman, made a statement about not wanting anyone to slip through the cracks.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a direct restatement of the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.,There is a river called the Weantic River.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.""
   - This indicates that there is a river named ""Weweantic River"" and it flows through a pond.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""There is a river called the Weantic River.""
   - This suggests the existence of a river named ""Weantic River.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions ""Weweantic River,"" while the Hypothesis mentions ""Weantic River.""
   - The names ""Weweantic"" and ""Weantic"" are different, which implies that the Hypothesis is referring to a different river than the one mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis refers to a river with a different name, it cannot be definitively true based on the information given in the Premise.
   - The Premise does not provide any information about a river called ""Weantic River,"" so we cannot confirm or deny the existence of such a river based on the Premise alone.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation output is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.,The Weweantic River does not flow through the pond.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.""
   - This statement asserts that the Weweantic River flows through the pond.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""The Weweantic River does not flow through the pond.""
   - This statement asserts that the Weweantic River does not flow through the pond.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the river flows through the pond.
   - The Hypothesis states that the river does not flow through the pond.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the Premise is true, the Hypothesis cannot be true, and vice versa.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the appropriate numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.,Water from the Weweantic River moves through the pond.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.""
   - This means that the river's water moves through the pond, indicating a flow of water from the river into and possibly out of the pond.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Water from the Weweantic River moves through the pond.""
   - This suggests that water originating from the Weweantic River is moving through the pond.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the movement of water from the Weweantic River through the pond.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise, maintaining the same meaning.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they convey the same information), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.,In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital to appeal for an end to prescription drug abuse.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.""
   - Key points: 
     - Location: Cambodia, capital Phnom Penh
     - Action: Several hundred people marched
     - Purpose: Appeal for an end to growing drug use

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital to appeal for an end to prescription drug abuse.""
   - Key points:
     - Location: Cambodia, capital (Phnom Penh is implied but not explicitly mentioned)
     - Action: Several hundred people marched
     - Purpose: Appeal for an end to prescription drug abuse

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention a march in Cambodia's capital by several hundred people.
   - The purpose of the march in the Premise is to appeal for an end to ""growing drug use,"" which is a general term.
   - The purpose of the march in the Hypothesis is to appeal for an end to ""prescription drug abuse,"" which is a specific type of drug use.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis specifies a particular type of drug use (prescription drug abuse) that is not explicitly mentioned in the Premise.
   - The Premise's ""growing drug use"" could include prescription drug abuse, but it is not certain.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.,In Cambodia few people walked through the capital Phnom Penh to deny an end to growing drug use.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.""

### Hypothesis:
""In Cambodia few people walked through the capital Phnom Penh to deny an end to growing drug use.""

### Analysis:
1. **Quantitative Difference**:
   - Premise: ""several hundred people""
   - Hypothesis: ""few people""
   - The Premise indicates a large number of people, while the Hypothesis indicates a small number. This is a significant difference.

2. **Action Difference**:
   - Premise: ""MARCHED""
   - Hypothesis: ""walked""
   - While ""marched"" and ""walked"" can be similar, ""marched"" often implies a more organized or purposeful action compared to ""walked.""

3. **Purpose Difference**:
   - Premise: ""to appeal for an end to growing drug use""
   - Hypothesis: ""to deny an end to growing drug use""
   - The Premise indicates that the people are appealing for an end to drug use, while the Hypothesis suggests they are denying an end to drug use. These purposes are directly contradictory.

### Conclusion:
Given the significant differences in the number of people, the nature of their action, and especially their purpose (appealing for an end vs. denying an end), the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

### Relation:
2 – Contradiction

Therefore, the relation is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.,Several hundred people marched to appeal the end of growing drug use in Cambodia through the capital Phnom Penh.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.""
   - Key points:
     - Location: Cambodia, specifically the capital Phnom Penh.
     - Action: Several hundred people marched.
     - Purpose: To appeal for an end to growing drug use.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Several hundred people marched to appeal the end of growing drug use in Cambodia through the capital Phnom Penh.""
   - Key points:
     - Location: Cambodia, specifically the capital Phnom Penh.
     - Action: Several hundred people marched.
     - Purpose: To appeal for an end to growing drug use.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the same location (Cambodia, Phnom Penh).
   - Both mention the same action (several hundred people marched).
   - Both mention the same purpose (to appeal for an end to growing drug use).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details.
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,In VERY vivid detail I remember FALLING down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door.,"The speaker had great memory of events, but not great balance since they fell down the stairs like that.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker remembers falling down the first flight of stairs in their house onto the landing in front of the main door.
   - The memory is described as ""VERY vivid,"" indicating a strong and clear recollection of the event.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis makes two claims:
     1. The speaker had great memory of events.
     2. The speaker did not have great balance since they fell down the stairs.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The first part of the hypothesis (""The speaker had great memory of events"") is supported by the premise, which describes the memory as ""VERY vivid.""
   - The second part of the hypothesis (""not great balance since they fell down the stairs"") is an inference based on the event described in the premise. However, the premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the speaker generally has poor balance. It only describes a single incident of falling.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The first part of the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.
   - The second part of the hypothesis is an additional inference that may or may not be true based on the given information.

Given that the hypothesis includes an inference that is not definitively supported or contradicted by the premise, the overall relationship is best described as Neutral.

intransitive-motion,schematic,In VERY vivid detail I remember FALLING down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door.,I don't remember at all falling down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker remembers falling down the first flight of stairs in their house onto the landing in front of the main door.
   - The memory is described as being in ""VERY vivid detail,"" indicating a strong and clear recollection.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The speaker claims they do not remember at all falling down the first flight of stairs in their house onto the landing in front of the main door.
   - This directly contradicts the statement in the premise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker has a very vivid memory of the event.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker has no memory of the event.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise because it states the opposite of what the Premise asserts.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,In VERY vivid detail I remember FALLING down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door.,I fell down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door and I remember it all in very vivid detail.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""In VERY vivid detail I remember FALLING down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door.""
Hypothesis: ""I fell down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door and I remember it all in very vivid detail.""

1. **Content Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker remembers falling down the first flight of stairs in their house onto the landing in front of the main door in very vivid detail.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker fell down the first flight of stairs in their house onto the landing in front of the main door and remembers it all in very vivid detail.

2. **Information Overlap**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: falling down the first flight of stairs onto the landing in front of the main door.
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that the memory of this event is in very vivid detail.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with the same meaning.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because it restates the same event and details.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,"People who SPILLED over from the ""protest"" attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.",An innocent person was driving down Regent Street when their car was attacked by protestors.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""People who SPILLED over from the 'protest' attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.""
   - This indicates that individuals from a protest attacked a car on Regent Street.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""An innocent person was driving down Regent Street when their car was attacked by protestors.""
   - This suggests that a person, who is described as innocent, was driving on Regent Street and their car was attacked by protestors.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions that people from a protest attacked a car on Regent Street.
   - The Hypothesis adds the detail that the person driving the car was innocent.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not provide information about the innocence of the person driving the car. It only states that the car was attacked by protestors.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new element (the innocence of the driver) that is not addressed in the Premise.

Given that the Premise does not confirm or deny the innocence of the driver, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,"People who SPILLED over from the ""protest"" attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.","People who spilled over from the ""protest"" quietly watched their car as it went down Regent Street. (AMR)",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that people who spilled over from the protest attacked a car as it went down Regent Street.
   - Key elements: ""spilled over from the protest,"" ""attacked their car,"" ""went down Regent Street.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that people who spilled over from the protest quietly watched a car as it went down Regent Street.
   - Key elements: ""spilled over from the protest,"" ""quietly watched their car,"" ""went down Regent Street.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis mention people who spilled over from the protest and a car going down Regent Street.
   - The main difference lies in the actions of the people: 
     - Premise: ""attacked their car.""
     - Hypothesis: ""quietly watched their car.""

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the premise and the hypothesis are contradictory. If people attacked the car, they could not have quietly watched it at the same time.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

**Relation Output**: 2",**Relation Output**: 2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"People who SPILLED over from the ""protest"" attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.","Their car was attacked by people who spilled over from the ""protest"" as it went down Regent Street.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""People who SPILLED over from the 'protest' attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.""
   - This sentence indicates that a group of people, who were part of a protest and then moved beyond its boundaries, attacked a car while it was traveling down Regent Street.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Their car was attacked by people who spilled over from the 'protest' as it went down Regent Street.""
   - This sentence states that a car was attacked by people who had moved beyond the boundaries of a protest while the car was traveling down Regent Street.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: a car being attacked by people who spilled over from a protest while it was on Regent Street.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise without changing the meaning or introducing any new information.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and does not add or contradict any information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.",Marchers will proceed on Market until they reach the capital building.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.""
   - This indicates a specific route that the marchers will take: starting on Pine St., then moving to Broadway, and finally to Market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Marchers will proceed on Market until they reach the capital building.""
   - This suggests that the marchers will continue on Market Street until they reach a specific destination, the capital building.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides a route but does not mention any destination or continuation beyond Market Street.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new element (the capital building) and implies that the marchers will continue on Market Street until they reach this destination.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the marchers will proceed on Market until they reach the capital building. The Premise does not mention the capital building or any continuation beyond Market Street.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide information about the final destination or continuation on Market Street, so it is possible but not certain that the marchers will proceed to the capital building.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that directly conflicts with the Hypothesis. There is no such conflict here; the Premise does not rule out the possibility of the marchers continuing to the capital building.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.",Marchers will stop at Pine St and not continue to Broadway nor Market.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.""
   - This indicates that the marchers will continue their march from Pine St. to Broadway and then to Market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Marchers will stop at Pine St and not continue to Broadway nor Market.""
   - This suggests that the marchers will halt their progress at Pine St. and will not proceed to Broadway or Market.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise clearly states that the marchers will continue their route from Pine St. to Broadway and then to Market.
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that the marchers will stop at Pine St. and will not continue to Broadway or Market.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise, it cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.","From Pine St., to Broadway, then to Market marchers will continue.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.""
Hypothesis: ""From Pine St., to Broadway, then to Market marchers will continue.""

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that marchers will proceed on Pine St. to Broadway, and then to Market.
   - The Hypothesis states that marchers will continue from Pine St., to Broadway, and then to Market.

2. **Paraphrasing Check**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of streets: Pine St., Broadway, and Market.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but maintains the same meaning and order of streets.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new elements that would make it uncertain or neutral.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis is a paraphrase of the Premise and conveys the same information.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,"Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to MARCH around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.","Mine workers and supporters are protesting for fair wages at the Peabody Energy in St. Louis on this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information provided in each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to MARCH around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.""
   - Key points:
     - Thousands of mine workers and supporters.
     - Plan to march.
     - Location: Headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis.
     - Date: This coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Mine workers and supporters are protesting for fair wages at the Peabody Energy in St. Louis on this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.""
   - Key points:
     - Mine workers and supporters.
     - Protesting for fair wages.
     - Location: Peabody Energy in St. Louis.
     - Date: This coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention mine workers and supporters.
   - Both mention the event happening at the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis.
   - Both specify the date as this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.
   - The Premise states that they plan to ""march,"" while the Hypothesis states they are ""protesting for fair wages.""

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not specify the reason for the march, only that it is planned.
   - The Hypothesis adds the detail that the march is a protest for fair wages.
   - Since the Premise does not provide information about the reason for the march, we cannot definitively conclude that the Hypothesis is true or false based on the Premise alone.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to MARCH around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.","No mine workers or supporters plan to march around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.",2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that ""Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to MARCH around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.""
   - Key points: 
     - Thousands of mine workers and supporters
     - Plan to march
     - Location: headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis
     - Date: this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that ""No mine workers or supporters plan to march around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.""
   - Key points:
     - No mine workers or supporters
     - Plan to march
     - Location: headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis
     - Date: this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates that thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to march.
   - The hypothesis states that no mine workers or supporters plan to march.
   - These two statements are directly contradictory. The premise asserts the presence of a plan to march, while the hypothesis denies any such plan.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the direct contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis, the relationship is a contradiction.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to MARCH around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.","This coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th at Peabody Energy in St. Louis thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to march around the headquarters.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the content step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to MARCH around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""This coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th at Peabody Energy in St. Louis thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to march around the headquarters.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same information: the event (marching around the headquarters), the participants (thousands of mine workers and supporters), the location (headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis), and the date (this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th).
   - The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is identical.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,"He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet , when a coil of gold , the color of the moonlight , FLASHED across the sand .","The man had vistied a totally different planet covered in sand that had looked like the wrong one, when a light flashed across the sand.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, FLASHED across the sand.""

### Hypothesis:
""The man had visited a totally different planet covered in sand that had looked like the wrong one, when a light flashed across the sand.""

### Analysis:
1. **Subject and Context**:
   - **Premise**: A man is on a planet and is afraid he might be on the wrong one. A coil of gold, resembling moonlight, flashes across the sand.
   - **Hypothesis**: A man is on a different planet covered in sand, which he thought was the wrong one, and a light flashes across the sand.

2. **Key Elements**:
   - **Premise**: 
     - The man is afraid he is on the wrong planet.
     - A coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashes across the sand.
   - **Hypothesis**:
     - The man is on a different planet covered in sand.
     - He thought it was the wrong planet.
     - A light flashes across the sand.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The **Premise** does not explicitly state that the planet is different or covered in sand, only that the man is afraid he might be on the wrong planet.
   - The **Hypothesis** adds the detail that the planet is different and covered in sand, which is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.
   - Both mention something flashing across the sand, but the Premise specifies it as a ""coil of gold, the color of moonlight,"" while the Hypothesis generalizes it as ""a light.""

### Conclusion:
- The Hypothesis introduces additional details (different planet, covered in sand) that are not confirmed or denied by the Premise.
- The flashing light detail is somewhat consistent but not exactly the same as the ""coil of gold"" in the Premise.
- Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

### Final Decision:
The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

**Relation Output: 1**",**Relation Output: 1**,False,True,False,1

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, FLASHED across the sand.""
   - Key points: The subject (he) was starting to feel fear about being on the wrong planet. This fear is occurring at the same time as a coil of gold, described as moonlight-colored, flashes across the sand.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""He was not afraid that he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand.""
   - Key points: The subject (he) is described as not feeling fear about being on the wrong planet. This is in direct contrast to the premise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates that the subject was beginning to feel afraid.
   - The hypothesis states the opposite, that the subject was not afraid.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. The premise says he was beginning to be afraid, while the hypothesis says he was not afraid.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet , when a coil of gold , the color of the moonlight , FLASHED across the sand .","A coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand as he was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, FLASHED across the sand.""
   - This sentence describes a situation where someone is starting to feel fear about being on the wrong planet, and at that moment, a coil of gold, which is the color of moonlight, flashes across the sand.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""A coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand as he was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet.""
   - This sentence describes the same situation but rephrased. It states that a coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand while he was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event with the same details: a coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashing across the sand at the moment when he was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with no change in meaning or details.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the exact same information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I RAN around the track.,I run professionally.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I RAN around the track.""
   - This indicates that the speaker performed the action of running around a track at some point in the past.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I run professionally.""
   - This suggests that the speaker engages in running as a profession, implying regular and possibly competitive running.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a single instance of running around a track.
   - The Hypothesis describes a habitual or professional engagement in running.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise would need to indicate that the speaker runs professionally. However, the Premise only mentions a single instance of running, which does not necessarily imply professional running.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny that the speaker runs professionally. It is possible that someone who ran around a track once could also run professionally, but it is not a certainty.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise if the Premise explicitly contradicted the idea of professional running. However, the Premise does not provide any information that would directly contradict the Hypothesis.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,I RAN around the track.,I walked around the track.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""I RAN around the track.""
   - This statement indicates that the person performed the action of running around the track.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I walked around the track.""
   - This statement indicates that the person performed the action of walking around the track.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Running and walking are two different actions. Running generally implies a faster pace than walking.
   - If someone ran around the track, it implies they did not walk around the track, as running and walking are mutually exclusive in this context.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the actions of running and walking are different and cannot both be true simultaneously in this context, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,I RAN around the track.,I circled the track by running.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""I RAN around the track.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker performed the action of running and did so around a track.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""I circled the track by running.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker circled the track, and the method of doing so was by running.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action (running) and the same location (the track).
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.
   - The action of running around the track inherently means circling the track by running.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and does not add or contradict any information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DROVE through the tunnel.,I was driving in my car,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""I DROVE through the tunnel.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker was driving and went through a tunnel.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I was driving in my car.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker was driving a car.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that the speaker drove through a tunnel, which implies that the speaker was driving.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker was driving in a car. 

4. **Inference**:
   - The act of driving through a tunnel strongly implies that the speaker was driving a vehicle, most likely a car, as it is the most common vehicle for such an activity.
   - There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the Hypothesis. In fact, the Premise supports the idea that the speaker was driving a car.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DROVE through the tunnel.,I avoided the tunnel.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""I DROVE through the tunnel.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker traveled through the tunnel by driving.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I avoided the tunnel.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker did not go through the tunnel, implying they took a different route or means to avoid it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker drove through the tunnel.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker avoided the tunnel.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If the speaker drove through the tunnel, it is impossible for them to have avoided it at the same time.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Final Relation Output: 2",Final Relation Output: 2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DROVE through the tunnel.,I went throught the tunnel by driving.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""I DROVE through the tunnel.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker used a vehicle to pass through a tunnel.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I went through the tunnel by driving.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker passed through the tunnel and specifies that the mode of transportation was driving.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker drove through the tunnel.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker went through the tunnel by driving.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with the same meaning.
   - Both statements indicate the same action (going through the tunnel) and the same mode of transportation (driving).

Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is:

0 – Entailment

Therefore, the relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,We DROVE past the hotel.,We DROVE all the way to the next city.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""We DROVE past the hotel.""
   - This statement indicates that the driving occurred past a specific point, which is the hotel.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""We DROVE all the way to the next city.""
   - This statement suggests that the driving continued until reaching the next city.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions driving past the hotel but does not specify the final destination.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that the driving continued until reaching the next city.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny that the driving continued to the next city. It only states that the driving went past the hotel.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,We DROVE past the hotel.,We drove straight to the hotel.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""We DROVE past the hotel.""
   - This indicates that the action of driving occurred and the hotel was a landmark that was passed by during the drive.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""We drove straight to the hotel.""
   - This suggests that the destination of the drive was the hotel and that the driving was direct to that location.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the hotel was passed by, implying that the hotel was not the final destination or that the driving did not stop at the hotel.
   - The Hypothesis states that the driving was directly to the hotel, implying that the hotel was the final destination.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the Premise is true (that they drove past the hotel), then the Hypothesis (that they drove straight to the hotel) cannot be true because driving past the hotel contradicts the idea of driving straight to it.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct relation output is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,We DROVE past the hotel.,We were driving when we went past the hotel.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""We DROVE past the hotel.""
   - This indicates that the action of driving past the hotel has already occurred. The use of ""DROVE"" suggests that the action is in the past tense.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""We were driving when we went past the hotel.""
   - This statement suggests that the action of driving was ongoing at the time they went past the hotel. The use of ""were driving"" indicates a continuous action in the past.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that they drove past the hotel, which implies that they were indeed driving at that time.
   - The Hypothesis states that they were driving when they went past the hotel, which is consistent with the information given in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because the action of driving past the hotel inherently means they were driving at that time.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.,The plane flew to its destination of California.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.""
   - This statement tells us that the plane's flight path included flying over the Grand Canyon. It does not provide information about the plane's final destination or any other part of its journey.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The plane flew to its destination of California.""
   - This statement asserts that the plane's final destination was California.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise only mentions that the plane flew over the Grand Canyon. It does not specify where the plane was coming from or where it was going.
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information by stating that the plane's destination was California, which is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide any information about the plane's destination, we cannot definitively conclude that the plane's destination was California based on the Premise alone.
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. There is no direct contradiction, but there is also no entailment.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.,The plane didn't pass over the Grand Canyon.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.""
   - This statement asserts that the plane traveled above the Grand Canyon.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The plane didn't pass over the Grand Canyon.""
   - This statement asserts that the plane did not travel above the Grand Canyon.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the plane did fly over the Grand Canyon.
   - The Hypothesis states that the plane did not fly over the Grand Canyon.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the Premise is true, the Hypothesis cannot be true, and vice versa.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.,The plane was flying when it went over the Grand Canyon.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.
Hypothesis: The plane was flying when it went over the Grand Canyon.

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The Premise states that a plane flew over the Grand Canyon. This means that at some point in time, the plane was in the air and traveled over the Grand Canyon.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The Hypothesis states that the plane was flying when it went over the Grand Canyon. This implies that during the time the plane was over the Grand Canyon, it was in the act of flying.

3. **Comparing the Premise and the Hypothesis:**
   - The Premise explicitly states that the plane flew over the Grand Canyon.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases this by stating that the plane was flying when it went over the Grand Canyon.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise in different words.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis must be true because if a plane flew over the Grand Canyon, it was indeed flying when it went over the Grand Canyon.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .,I pass by Watkins Landing on my way into work and back home.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This means the speaker drives by Watkins Landing twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I pass by Watkins Landing on my way into work and back home.""
   - This implies the speaker passes by Watkins Landing twice a day, once on the way to work and once on the way back home.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action of passing by Watkins Landing twice a day.
   - The Premise specifies the times as ""morning and evening,"" while the Hypothesis specifies the context as ""on my way into work and back home.""
   - The context provided in the Hypothesis (going to work and coming back home) aligns with the times mentioned in the Premise (morning and evening).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because the actions described are essentially the same, just framed differently.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .,I avoid going past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This means the speaker regularly drives past Watkins Landing twice a day.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I avoid going past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This means the speaker makes an effort not to go past Watkins Landing at those times.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a regular action of driving past Watkins Landing.
   - The Hypothesis indicates a regular action of avoiding driving past Watkins Landing.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If the speaker drives past Watkins Landing every morning and evening, it directly contradicts the idea that the speaker avoids going past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .,My driving route goes past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This indicates that the speaker drives past a specific location, Watkins Landing, twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""My driving route goes past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This suggests that the speaker's driving route includes passing by Watkins Landing twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action: driving past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and does not add or contradict any information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail .,I commute by bike to stay healthy and enjoy the views from the Huguenot Trail.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail.""
   - This indicates that the speaker regularly travels to and from work using the Huguenot Trail.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I commute by bike to stay healthy and enjoy the views from the Huguenot Trail.""
   - This suggests that the speaker commutes by bike, with the motivations of staying healthy and enjoying the views.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions commuting on the Huguenot Trail but does not specify the mode of transportation or the reasons for commuting.
   - The Hypothesis adds specific details about the mode of transportation (by bike) and the reasons for commuting (to stay healthy and enjoy the views).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude the Hypothesis. In this case, the Premise does not specify the mode of transportation or the reasons for commuting, so we cannot definitively conclude the Hypothesis from the Premise.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, but it also does not provide enough information to confirm it. The additional details in the Hypothesis (commuting by bike, staying healthy, enjoying views) are plausible but not necessarily implied by the Premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that directly conflicts with the Hypothesis. There is no such conflict here; the Premise does not rule out commuting by bike or the reasons given in the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail .,I go around the Hugenot Trail as I go back and forth to work.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail.""
   - This means the person travels to and from work using the Huguenot Trail.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I go around the Huguenot Trail as I go back and forth to work.""
   - This implies that the person avoids the Huguenot Trail while commuting to and from work.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the person uses the Huguenot Trail for commuting.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that the person does not use the Huguenot Trail but instead goes around it.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise and the Hypothesis present opposite actions regarding the use of the Huguenot Trail (using it vs. avoiding it), the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail .,I take the Hugenot Trail back and forth to work.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail.""
Hypothesis: ""I take the Hugenot Trail back and forth to work.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The speaker commutes back and forth to work.
   - The commuting route is the Huguenot Trail.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker takes the Huguenot Trail back and forth to work.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Both statements mention commuting back and forth to work.
   - Both statements specify the route as the Huguenot Trail.
   - The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is the same.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise using different words.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced.

Given that the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the information provided in the Premise, the relationship is:

0 – Entailment

Therefore, the relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Dade County and federal authorities, learning that he intended to FLY through Miami, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.","Dade County and federal authorities, who are famous for daring arrests, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.",1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""Dade County and federal authorities, learning that he intended to FLY through Miami, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.""

Hypothesis: ""Dade County and federal authorities, who are famous for daring arrests, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.""

1. **Identify the main components of the Premise:**
   - Authorities involved: Dade County and federal authorities.
   - Action: Made plans to arrest him.
   - Reason: Gun-running charges.
   - Condition: As soon as he hit U.S. soil.
   - Additional information: They learned he intended to fly through Miami.

2. **Identify the main components of the Hypothesis:**
   - Authorities involved: Dade County and federal authorities.
   - Action: Made plans to arrest him.
   - Reason: Gun-running charges.
   - Condition: As soon as he hit U.S. soil.
   - Additional information: Authorities are famous for daring arrests.

3. **Compare the components:**
   - The main actions and conditions in both the Premise and Hypothesis are identical: plans to arrest on gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.
   - The additional information in the Hypothesis (""who are famous for daring arrests"") is not present in the Premise.

4. **Determine the impact of the additional information:**
   - The additional information in the Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise.
   - The fame for daring arrests is an extra detail that does not affect the truth of the main action described in the Premise.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise because the additional information about the authorities being famous for daring arrests is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Dade County and federal authorities, learning that he intended to FLY through Miami, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.","Dade County and federal authorities, didn't know that he intended to FLY through Miami, so they didn't make plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Dade County and federal authorities, learning that he intended to FLY through Miami, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.""
   - This means that the authorities were aware of his intention to fly through Miami and, based on this information, they made plans to arrest him.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Dade County and federal authorities, didn't know that he intended to FLY through Miami, so they didn't make plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.""
   - This suggests that the authorities were not aware of his intention to fly through Miami and, as a result, did not make any plans to arrest him.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the authorities knew about his intention and made plans to arrest him.
   - The Hypothesis states the opposite: the authorities did not know about his intention and did not make plans to arrest him.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise. The Premise asserts knowledge and action by the authorities, while the Hypothesis asserts ignorance and inaction.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Dade County and federal authorities, learning that he intended to FLY through Miami, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.",Dade County and federal authorities made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he touched U.S. soil once they learned he intended to fly into Miami.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information provided in both statements:

**Premise:**
- Dade County and federal authorities learned that he intended to fly through Miami.
- They made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges.
- The arrest was planned to occur as soon as he hit U.S. soil.

**Hypothesis:**
- Dade County and federal authorities made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges.
- The arrest was planned to occur as soon as he touched U.S. soil.
- This plan was made once they learned he intended to fly into Miami.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**
1. **Subject Consistency:** Both the Premise and the Hypothesis refer to the same authorities (Dade County and federal) and the same individual (the person they plan to arrest).
2. **Action Consistency:** Both statements mention the authorities' plan to arrest the individual on gun-running charges.
3. **Condition Consistency:** Both statements specify that the arrest is planned to occur as soon as the individual hits/touches U.S. soil.
4. **Temporal Consistency:** Both statements indicate that the authorities made the arrest plans after learning about the individual's intention to fly through/into Miami.

**Conclusion:**
- The Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise with slight rephrasing but does not introduce any new information or contradictions.
- The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Oguz mentioned that anyone flying over major opium-producing areas would see a lot of small fires in the mountains.
   - These small fires are identified as heroin labs.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that major opium-producing areas that house heroin labs can be spotted by looking for small fires from high above.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise provides specific information that flying over opium-producing areas reveals small fires, which are heroin labs.
   - The hypothesis generalizes this information by stating that these areas can be identified by looking for small fires from high above.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis is a logical conclusion derived from the premise. If anyone flying over these areas can see small fires, and these fires are heroin labs, then it follows that these areas can be identified by looking for small fires from above.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

     - These small fires are heroin labs.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Oguz said that anyone flying over the major opium producing areas would not be able to see any small fires in the mountains, which are heroin labs.
   - Key points:
     - Flying over major opium producing areas.
     - Not being able to see any small fires in the mountains.
     - These small fires are heroin labs.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that small fires (heroin labs) are visible when flying over the major opium producing areas.
   - The Hypothesis states the opposite: that small fires (heroin labs) are not visible when flying over the same areas.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise asserts visibility of small fires, while the Hypothesis asserts the lack of visibility of small fires.

Given this direct contradiction, the appropriate relation is:

**2 – Contradiction**

Final answer:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that each year, over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter in Hong Kong.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that each year, over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers and have inspired beautiful art for generations.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis agree on the fact that over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers each year.
   - The premise adds that these birds choose to roost for winter in Hong Kong.
   - The hypothesis adds that these birds have inspired beautiful art for generations.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The additional information in the hypothesis about the birds inspiring beautiful art is not mentioned in the premise. This means the hypothesis introduces new information that is not directly supported or contradicted by the premise.
   - The hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but it also does not follow necessarily from the premise. The premise does not provide any information about the birds inspiring art.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **Neutral** because the hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1

Premise: Each year, over 50,000 migratory birds FLY over Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here.

Hypothesis: Each year, over 50,000 migratory birds go around Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose to not roost for winter here.

1. **Compare the actions of the birds:**
   - Premise: The birds ""FLY over"" the skyscrapers.
   - Hypothesis: The birds ""go around"" the skyscrapers.
   - These actions are different. ""Fly over"" implies passing above the skyscrapers, while ""go around"" implies avoiding flying over them.

2. **Compare the roosting behavior:**
   - Premise: The birds ""choose to roost for winter here.""
   - Hypothesis: The birds ""choose to not roost for winter here.""
   - These behaviors are directly contradictory. The Premise states that the birds roost in Hong Kong, while the Hypothesis states that they do not.

Given these points, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Each year , over 50,000 migratory birds FLY over Hong Kong 's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here .","Over 50,000 migratory birds choose to roost for winter each year as they fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: Each year, over 50,000 migratory birds FLY over Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here.
Hypothesis: Over 50,000 migratory birds choose to roost for winter each year as they fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers.

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention ""over 50,000 migratory birds.""
   - Both state that these birds ""fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers.""
   - Both indicate that these birds ""choose to roost for winter"" in Hong Kong.
   - Both specify that this event happens ""each year.""

2. **Paraphrasing Check**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. The order of the information is slightly different, but the meaning remains the same.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that is not present in the Premise.
   - There is no information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the same information, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,But it's all FLYING right over your head.,They are not understanding the point.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""But it's all FLYING right over your head.""
   - This phrase is an idiom that means someone is not understanding or grasping the point being made.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""They are not understanding the point.""
   - This statement directly states that someone is not understanding the point.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The idiom ""FLYING right over your head"" in the Premise implies the same meaning as the Hypothesis, which is that someone is not understanding the point.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a direct restatement of the meaning of the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,But it's all FLYING right over your head.,But it's all sticking in your head.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""But it's all FLYING right over your head.""
   - This suggests that the information or situation is not being understood or noticed by the person being addressed.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""But it's all sticking in your head.""
   - This suggests that the information or situation is being understood and remembered by the person being addressed.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a lack of understanding or awareness.
   - The Hypothesis indicates a clear understanding and retention of information.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis present opposite situations regarding the understanding of information.
   - If something is ""flying right over your head,"" it means you are not understanding it.
   - If something is ""sticking in your head,"" it means you are understanding and remembering it.

Given these points, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,But it's all FLYING right over your head.,But it's all going right over your head.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""But it's all FLYING right over your head.""
Hypothesis: ""But it's all going right over your head.""

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - Premise: ""FLYING right over your head.""
   - Hypothesis: ""going right over your head.""

2. **Compare the Key Elements:**
   - The main difference between the Premise and the Hypothesis is the word ""FLYING"" in the Premise and ""going"" in the Hypothesis.
   - Both phrases convey the idea that something is happening above the person's head and they are not understanding or noticing it.

3. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The word ""FLYING"" is more specific than ""going,"" but in the context of the sentence, both words imply the same general meaning.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a paraphrase of the Premise with a slight change in wording that does not alter the overall meaning.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise and there is no contradiction or uncertainty, the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the relation is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,"It will be like you're FLOATING along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.",Quitting smoking may imrove your ability to swim and complete other cardiovascular exercises.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise describes a situation where a person feels fine and then suddenly experiences a strong urge to smoke.
   - Key elements: ""FLOATING along fine,"" ""caught up in this huge swell,"" ""urge to smoke.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis suggests that quitting smoking may improve one's ability to swim and perform other cardiovascular exercises.
   - Key elements: ""Quitting smoking,"" ""improve your ability to swim,"" ""complete other cardiovascular exercises.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise talks about the experience of an urge to smoke, using a metaphor of floating and being caught in a swell.
   - The hypothesis discusses the potential benefits of quitting smoking on physical activities like swimming and cardiovascular exercises.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be definitely true given the premise, the premise would need to provide information that directly supports the benefits of quitting smoking on physical activities. The premise does not provide this information.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise does not provide any information about the benefits of quitting smoking, so it is possible but not certain.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The hypothesis cannot be true given the premise. There is no information in the premise that directly contradicts the hypothesis.

Given that the premise does not provide information that either supports or contradicts the hypothesis, the relationship is best described as neutral.

**Final Decision**:
1

intransitive-motion,schematic,"It will be like you're FLOATING along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.","It will be like you're stopped, unable to move, then finally you are freed by the urge to smoke.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""It will be like you're FLOATING along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.""
Hypothesis: ""It will be like you're stopped, unable to move, then finally you are freed by the urge to smoke.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The premise describes a situation where someone is ""floating along fine,"" implying a state of ease or normalcy.
   - Suddenly, this person is ""caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke,"" indicating a sudden and overwhelming desire to smoke.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis describes a situation where someone is ""stopped, unable to move,"" implying a state of being stuck or immobilized.
   - Then, this person is ""freed by the urge to smoke,"" suggesting that the urge to smoke releases them from their immobilized state.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The premise and hypothesis describe different initial states: ""floating along fine"" (ease) vs. ""stopped, unable to move"" (immobilized).
   - The premise describes the urge to smoke as a sudden overwhelming force, while the hypothesis describes it as something that frees the person from being stuck.

4. **Determining the Relation:**
   - The hypothesis presents a scenario that is different from the premise. The initial states and the effects of the urge to smoke are not aligned.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, and the two statements are contradictory.

Based on this analysis, the relation between the Premise and Hypothesis is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"It will be like you're FLOATING along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.",In an instant you will be caught up in this huge urge to smoke after feeling like you're floating along fine.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information provided:

### Premise:
""It will be like you're FLOATING along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.""

### Hypothesis:
""In an instant you will be caught up in this huge urge to smoke after feeling like you're floating along fine.""

### Analysis:
1. **Content Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a sequence of events: first, a state of ""floating along fine,"" followed by a sudden, overwhelming urge to smoke.
   
2. **Order and Causality**:
   - The Premise states that you will feel like you're floating along fine, and then suddenly, you will be caught up in a huge swell of the urge to smoke.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases this sequence, stating that in an instant, you will be caught up in a huge urge to smoke after feeling like you're floating along fine.

3. **Semantic Equivalence**:
   - The Hypothesis essentially restates the Premise in a slightly different order but maintains the same meaning and sequence of events.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because it accurately reflects the sequence and nature of events described in the Premise.

### Final Decision:
0 – Entailment

intransitive-motion,schematic,The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.,Laws change all the time throughout the years.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.""
   - This suggests that the law is expected to change frequently in the future.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Laws change all the time throughout the years.""
   - This suggests that laws are constantly changing over time.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a probable frequent change in the law in the future.
   - The Hypothesis states that laws are always changing over time, which is a more general statement about the nature of laws.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not definitively confirm that laws change all the time, but it does suggest frequent changes in the future.
   - The Hypothesis is a broader statement that could be true if the Premise is true, but the Premise alone does not guarantee the truth of the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.,The law will probably stay the same in the coming years.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.""
   - This suggests that the law is expected to change frequently or be unstable in the future.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""The law will probably stay the same in the coming years.""
   - This suggests that the law is expected to remain stable and unchanged in the future.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates instability and frequent changes in the law.
   - The Hypothesis indicates stability and no changes in the law.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis present opposite expectations about the future state of the law.
   - If the law is expected to change frequently (Premise), it cannot simultaneously be expected to stay the same (Hypothesis).

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Final Relation Output: 2",Final Relation Output: 2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.,In the coming years the law will most likely jump back and forth.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.
Hypothesis: In the coming years the law will most likely jump back and forth.

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis are discussing the same subject: the law.
   - Both sentences are referring to the same time frame: ""in the coming years.""
   - The action described in both sentences is the same: ""jump back and forth.""

2. **Modal Verbs**:
   - The Premise uses ""probably,"" which indicates a high likelihood.
   - The Hypothesis uses ""most likely,"" which also indicates a high likelihood.
   - Both modal verbs convey a similar degree of uncertainty, suggesting that the law is expected to jump back and forth but not with absolute certainty.

3. **Paraphrasing**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a paraphrase of the Premise. The structure of the sentences is different, but the meaning conveyed is the same.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise with the same meaning and level of certainty, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.,The 23 are scared the sub is sinking.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.""
   - This sentence describes a group of 23 individuals who are moving quickly and with urgency to the back of a submarine.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The 23 are scared the sub is sinking.""
   - This sentence suggests that the reason for the 23 individuals' frantic movement is fear that the submarine is sinking.

3. **Inference Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the 23 individuals are scared because they think the submarine is sinking. The Premise does not explicitly state the reason for their frantic movement.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it is not necessarily true. The Premise indicates frantic movement, which could be due to fear of sinking, but it could also be due to other reasons (e.g., an emergency drill, another type of danger, etc.).
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly opposes the idea that the 23 individuals are scared the sub is sinking. The Premise does not provide such contradictory information.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relationship is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.,The 23 were calm at the rear of the sub.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.""
   - This sentence indicates that a group of 23 individuals moved quickly and in a panicked manner to the rear of the submarine.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The 23 were calm at the rear of the sub.""
   - This sentence suggests that the same group of 23 individuals were in a state of calmness at the rear of the submarine.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes the 23 individuals as ""frantically SCRAMBLED,"" which implies a state of panic and urgency.
   - The Hypothesis describes the 23 individuals as ""calm,"" which is the opposite of being frantic or panicked.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise indicates a state of panic and urgency, and the Hypothesis indicates a state of calmness, these two states are mutually exclusive.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

intransitive-motion,schematic,The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.,The rear of the sub had 23 frantically scrambling towards it.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.""
Hypothesis: ""The rear of the sub had 23 frantically scrambling towards it.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The phrase ""The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub"" indicates that a group of 23 individuals moved quickly and in a disorganized manner towards the rear of the submarine.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The phrase ""The rear of the sub had 23 frantically scrambling towards it"" suggests that the rear of the submarine was the destination for 23 individuals who were moving quickly and in a disorganized manner.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: 23 individuals moving frantically towards the rear of the submarine.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the event described in the Premise without changing the meaning.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - Since the Hypothesis restates the event described in the Premise without adding or contradicting any information, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that ""IRNA reported that Gomshadzehi killed a policeman and then ESCAPED to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates while trafficking drugs in 2003.""
   - Key points: 
     - Gomshadzehi killed a policeman.
     - Gomshadzehi escaped to Dubai.
     - The events occurred in 2003.
     - Gomshadzehi was involved in drug trafficking.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that ""There is a criminal named Gomshadzehi who did not care about the lives of others or himself when he carried out his crimes in 2003.""
   - Key points:
     - Gomshadzehi is a criminal.
     - He did not care about the lives of others or himself.
     - He carried out his crimes in 2003.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise provides specific actions (killing a policeman, escaping to Dubai, drug trafficking) that suggest a disregard for the lives of others.
   - The hypothesis makes a general statement about Gomshadzehi's disregard for the lives of others and himself during his crimes in 2003.
   - The premise does not explicitly state that Gomshadzehi did not care about his own life, but it does imply a disregard for the lives of others through his violent and criminal actions.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis is a generalization based on the specific actions described in the premise.
   - The premise supports the idea that Gomshadzehi did not care about the lives of others, but it does not provide direct evidence about his attitude towards his own life.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise, as it introduces an additional element (disregard for his own life) that is not explicitly covered by the premise.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

   - **Source**: IRNA reported.
   - **Subject**: Gomshadzehi.
   - **Actions**: Helped a policeman, was captive in Dubai, trafficking drugs.
   - **Time**: 2003.

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Action 1**: Premise states Gomshadzehi ""killed a policeman,"" while the Hypothesis states Gomshadzehi ""helped a policeman."" These actions are directly contradictory.
   - **Action 2**: Premise states Gomshadzehi ""escaped to Dubai,"" while the Hypothesis states Gomshadzehi ""was captive in Dubai."" These actions are also directly contradictory.
   - **Action 3**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that Gomshadzehi was ""trafficking drugs in 2003.""

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis presents actions that are directly opposite to those in the Premise (killing vs. helping, escaping vs. being captive). Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Armed troops MARCHED to the substations and turned the power back on.""
   - This statement indicates that armed troops went to the substations and restored power.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Armed troops MARCHED to the substations that powered over half of the city.""
   - This statement suggests that the substations the troops marched to were responsible for powering over half of the city.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not specify the extent of the power coverage of the substations. It only mentions that the troops marched to the substations and turned the power back on.
   - The Hypothesis adds additional information about the substations, specifically that they powered over half of the city.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to confirm that the substations powered over half of the city. The Premise does not provide this specific detail.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true or false based on the information given in the Premise. The Premise does not confirm or deny the extent of the power coverage of the substations.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly conflicts with the Hypothesis. The Premise does not provide any information that contradicts the Hypothesis.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

   - This indicates that armed troops moved to the substations and restored the power.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Armed troops left the substations and turned the power off.""
   - This suggests that armed troops departed from the substations and cut off the power.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the troops went to the substations and turned the power on.
   - The Hypothesis states that the troops left the substations and turned the power off.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict the actions described in the Premise.
   - The Premise indicates the power was turned on, while the Hypothesis indicates the power was turned off.
   - Additionally, the Premise states the troops marched to the substations, whereas the Hypothesis states they left the substations.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Armed troops MARCHED to the substations and turned the power back on.""
   - This statement indicates that armed troops moved to the substations and performed the action of turning the power back on.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The power was turned back on by armed troops that marched to the substations.""
   - This statement rephrases the Premise, indicating that the power was turned back on by armed troops who marched to the substations.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of events: armed troops marched to the substations and turned the power back on.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a passive rephrasing of the active Premise.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Vietnam News Agency reported that Australian national Tran Van Thanh was arrested on 30 June 2003.
   - The arrest took place in the southern Vietnam city of Dalat.
   - Tran Van Thanh was involved in a network smuggling heroin from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Vietnam News Agency, which has earned several prizes for journalism, reported that Australian national Tran Van Thanh was arrested on 30 June 2003.
   - The arrest took place in the southern Vietnam city of Dalat.
   - Tran Van Thanh was involved in a network smuggling heroin.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the Vietnam News Agency and the arrest of Tran Van Thanh on 30 June 2003 in Dalat.
   - Both state that Tran Van Thanh was involved in a network smuggling heroin.
   - The Premise specifies the route of the smuggling: from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam.
   - The Hypothesis does not specify the route of the smuggling.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it simply omits some details (the specific smuggling route).
   - The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it does not provide enough information to be definitively true (since it lacks the route details).

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Vietnam News Agency reported that Tran Van Thanh, an Australian national, was arrested on 30 June 2003.
   - The arrest took place in the southern Vietnam city of Dalat.
   - Tran Van Thanh was involved in a network smuggling heroin from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Vietnam News Agency reported that Tran Van Thanh, an Australian national, was arrested on 30 June 2003.
   - The arrest took place in the southern Vietnam city of Dalat.
   - Tran Van Thanh was involved in a network hoarding and keeping heroin strictly in Cambodia.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree on the identity of the person (Tran Van Thanh), the date of arrest (30 June 2003), and the location of the arrest (Dalat, Vietnam).
   - The key difference lies in the nature of the network's activities:
     - Premise: The network was smuggling heroin from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam.
     - Hypothesis: The network was hoarding and keeping heroin strictly in Cambodia.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise states that the network was involved in smuggling heroin across multiple countries (Cambodia, Vietnam, and Australia).
   - The Hypothesis states that the network was only hoarding and keeping heroin within Cambodia, which directly contradicts the smuggling activity described in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because the activities described are mutually exclusive (smuggling vs. hoarding and keeping strictly in one country).

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases.
   - Indian officials suspect that poultry could be smuggled through Myanmar from Thailand.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Poultry smuggling from Thailand is the main way that disease and crime spreads to Myanmar.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that there are no reported H5N1 cases in Myanmar and mentions a suspicion by Indian officials about potential poultry smuggling from Thailand through Myanmar.
   - The Hypothesis makes a stronger claim, stating that poultry smuggling from Thailand is the main way that disease and crime spread to Myanmar.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the spread of disease and crime to Myanmar, nor does it confirm that poultry smuggling is the main way these issues spread.
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information that is not present in the Premise and makes a definitive claim about the main way disease and crime spread, which is not supported by the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. There is no direct contradiction, but there is also no definitive support for the Hypothesis.

   - Key points:
     - Myanmar has reported H5N1 cases.
     - Indian officials suspect poultry removal from Myanmar to Thailand.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases, while the Hypothesis states that Myanmar has reported H5N1 cases. This is a direct contradiction.
   - The Premise mentions smuggling poultry through Myanmar from Thailand, while the Hypothesis mentions removing poultry from Myanmar to Thailand. This is also contradictory in terms of the direction of movement.

Given these points, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the information provided in the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
caused-motion,schematic,Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases but Indian officials suspect that poultry could be SMUGGLED through Myanmar from Thailand.,Indian officials suspect that poultry could be smuggled through Myanmar from Thailand even though there's no reported H5N1 cases in Myanmar.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases.
   - Indian officials suspect that poultry could be smuggled through Myanmar from Thailand.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Indian officials suspect that poultry could be smuggled through Myanmar from Thailand.
   - There's no reported H5N1 cases in Myanmar.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis restates the suspicion of Indian officials about poultry smuggling through Myanmar from Thailand, which is directly mentioned in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis also mentions that there are no reported H5N1 cases in Myanmar, which is also stated in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the information given in the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the information provided in the Premise, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that seven hundred passengers on a train were stranded for two hours.
   - After being stranded, they were guided through the tunnels to a safe place.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that after being stranded for two hours, the passengers were determined to find another way to get to work.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise focuses on the passengers being guided to a safe place after being stranded.
   - The hypothesis introduces a new element: the passengers' determination to find another way to get to work, which is not mentioned in the premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise. It is possible that after being guided to a safe place, the passengers could have been determined to find another way to get to work.
   - However, the hypothesis introduces new information that is not present in the premise, making it uncertain whether this new information is true or not based on the given premise alone.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation output is:

   - The passengers were stranded for two hours.
   - They were guided through the tunnels to a safe place.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The passengers were stranded for two hours.
   - They were led away from the tunnels to a safe place.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that the passengers were stranded for two hours and were eventually taken to a safe place.
   - The key difference lies in the direction of movement:
     - Premise: ""guided through the tunnels""
     - Hypothesis: ""led away from the tunnels""

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise states that the passengers were guided through the tunnels, implying they moved within or along the tunnels.
   - The Hypothesis states that the passengers were led away from the tunnels, implying they moved out of or away from the tunnels.
   - These two statements are contradictory because moving through the tunnels and moving away from the tunnels are mutually exclusive actions.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the same number of passengers (seven hundred).
   - Both state that the passengers were stranded on the train for two hours.
   - Both indicate that the passengers were guided through tunnels to a safe place.
   - The sequence of events is the same in both: first, the passengers were stranded, and then they were guided to safety.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

caused-motion,schematic,If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they KICK you out the door talk to a retiree.,"If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once you retire, then check out how many retirees live in Florida.",1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

### Premise:
""If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they KICK you out the door talk to a retiree.""

### Hypothesis:
""If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once you retire, then check out how many retirees live in Florida.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The Premise suggests that if someone believes that the Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are ""kicked out"" (which implies being forced to leave or discharged), they should talk to a retiree to understand the reality.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The Hypothesis suggests that if someone believes that the Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they retire, they should check how many retirees live in Florida.

3. **Comparing the Two Statements:**
   - The Premise uses the phrase ""kicked out the door,"" which implies a forced departure or discharge.
   - The Hypothesis uses the term ""retire,"" which implies a voluntary departure after completing service.
   - The Premise suggests talking to a retiree to understand the lack of care, while the Hypothesis suggests checking the number of retirees in Florida, which is a different action and context.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The Premise and Hypothesis are discussing different scenarios: forced departure vs. voluntary retirement.
   - The actions suggested (talking to a retiree vs. checking the number of retirees in Florida) are different and do not directly relate to each other.
   - The Hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the Premise, nor does it contradict it directly. It introduces a new context and action.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as they discuss different scenarios and actions without direct contradiction or entailment.

### Final Relation:
1",1,False,True,False,1
caused-motion,schematic,If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they KICK you out the door talk to a retiree.,"If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they kick you out the door, don't bother talking to a retiree.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they KICK you out the door talk to a retiree.""
   - This suggests that if someone believes that the Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out, they should talk to a retiree.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they kick you out the door, don't bother talking to a retiree.""
   - This suggests that if someone believes that the Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out, they should not talk to a retiree.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise suggests talking to a retiree if someone thinks the Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after being kicked out.
   - The Hypothesis suggests the opposite action: not talking to a retiree under the same condition.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise advises talking to a retiree, while the Hypothesis advises against it.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
caused-motion,schematic,If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they KICK you out the door talk to a retiree.,Talk to a retiree if any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they kick you out the door.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they KICK you out the door talk to a retiree.""
   - This sentence suggests that if someone believes that the Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out, they should talk to a retiree.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Talk to a retiree if any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they kick you out the door.""
   - This sentence is a rephrasing of the premise. It suggests the same condition: if someone believes that the Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out, they should talk to a retiree.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same message. The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrased version of the Premise without changing the meaning.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis.

Given that the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is:

0 – Entailment

Therefore, the relation is:

caused-motion,schematic,I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.,It is challenging for them to understand what is allowed to happen.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.""

### Hypothesis:
""It is challenging for them to understand what is allowed to happen.""

### Analysis:
1. **Meaning of the Premise**:
   - The speaker is expressing difficulty in understanding how a certain situation was permitted to occur.

2. **Meaning of the Hypothesis**:
   - The statement suggests that it is challenging for ""them"" (which could be interpreted as the speaker or others) to understand what is allowed to happen.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis both convey a sense of difficulty in understanding a situation.
   - The Premise uses a first-person perspective (""I can't wrap my head around""), while the Hypothesis uses a third-person perspective (""It is challenging for them"").
   - The core idea in both statements is about the difficulty in understanding how something was allowed to happen.

### Conclusion:
- The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with a slight change in perspective.
- The meaning remains consistent between the two statements.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

### Final Relation:
0",0,True,False,False,0

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.""
   - This means the speaker is expressing confusion or inability to understand how a certain situation occurred.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I can understand perfectly how this was allowed to happen.""
   - This means the speaker is expressing clear understanding of how the situation occurred.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker cannot understand the situation.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker can understand the situation perfectly.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis are expressing opposite states of understanding.
   - If the Premise is true (the speaker cannot understand), then the Hypothesis (the speaker can understand perfectly) cannot be true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
caused-motion,schematic,I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.,"How any of this was allowed to happen, I can't wrap my head around.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.""
Hypothesis: ""How any of this was allowed to happen, I can't wrap my head around.""

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis contain the same information: the speaker is expressing confusion or disbelief about how a certain situation was allowed to occur.
   - The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is identical.

2. **Paraphrasing**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a paraphrase of the Premise. It rearranges the words but does not change the meaning.

3. **Logical Relationship**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise with no change in meaning, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct relation output is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
caused-motion,schematic,The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.,The MiG-25 is well-equipped compared to the Predator.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.""
   - This indicates that the MiG-25 launched an air-to-air missile (AAM) targeting the Predator.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The MiG-25 is well-equipped compared to the Predator.""
   - This suggests a comparison of the equipment or capabilities between the MiG-25 and the Predator, implying that the MiG-25 has superior equipment.

3. **Comparison and Inference**:
   - The Premise provides a specific action (firing an AAM) but does not provide explicit information about the overall equipment or capabilities of the MiG-25 compared to the Predator.
   - The Hypothesis makes a general statement about the MiG-25 being well-equipped, which is not directly supported or contradicted by the specific action mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the general statement made in the Hypothesis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Therefore, the appropriate relation code is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
caused-motion,schematic,The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.,The MiG-25 ceased fire at the Predator.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.""
   - This indicates that the MiG-25 launched an air-to-air missile (AAM) targeting the Predator.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that ""The MiG-25 ceased fire at the Predator.""
   - This indicates that the MiG-25 stopped firing at the Predator.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates an action of firing, while the Hypothesis indicates the cessation of firing.
   - These two actions are mutually exclusive; if the MiG-25 is firing, it cannot simultaneously be ceasing fire.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the action described in the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final output:

2",2,False,False,True,2
caused-motion,schematic,The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.,The Predator had an AAM fired at them by the MiG-25.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.""
   - This means that the MiG-25 launched an Air-to-Air Missile (AAM) targeting the Predator.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The Predator had an AAM fired at them by the MiG-25.""
   - This means that the Predator was targeted by an Air-to-Air Missile (AAM) launched by the MiG-25.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: the MiG-25 firing an AAM at the Predator.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise, maintaining the same meaning and details.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they describe the same event in different words), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
caused-motion,schematic,"Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.","Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base in Germany, where he stayed for weeks.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.""
   - Key information: Pope was flown to a specific U.S. military base located in Ramstein, Germany.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that ""Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base in Germany, where he stayed for weeks.""
   - Key information: Pope was flown to a U.S. military base in Germany and stayed there for weeks.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that Pope was flown to a U.S. military base in Germany.
   - The Premise specifies the exact location as Ramstein, while the Hypothesis does not specify the exact base but mentions a stay for weeks.
   - The additional information in the Hypothesis about the duration of the stay (""for weeks"") is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it adds extra information about the duration of the stay.
   - The additional detail about the stay duration (""for weeks"") is not confirmed or denied by the Premise, making it uncertain whether this detail is true or not based on the given Premise alone.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise**: ""Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.""
   - This statement asserts that the Pope was transported by air to a specific location, which is the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Pope didn't fly to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.""
   - This statement asserts that the Pope did not fly to the specified location, which directly contradicts the information given in the Premise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the Pope was flown to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.
   - The Hypothesis states that the Pope did not fly to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the Premise is true, the Hypothesis cannot be true.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final output:

   - Destination: U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany

2. **Identify the key information in the Hypothesis:**
   - Subject: Pope
   - Action: was flown
   - Destination: military base at Ramstein, Germany

3. **Compare the information:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the same subject (Pope) and the same action (was flown).
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the same destination (military base at Ramstein, Germany).

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details.
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise, maintaining the same meaning.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Subject: Australian Schapelle Corby
   - Action: Convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali
   - Outcome: Jailed for 20 years

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Subject: Schapelle Corby, who was Australian
   - Action: Got caught and was imprisoned
   - Reason: For something illegal

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis states that Schapelle Corby, who is Australian, got caught and was imprisoned for something illegal.
   - The Premise provides specific details: Schapelle Corby was convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali and was jailed for 20 years.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it is consistent with the information provided.
   - The Hypothesis is a more general statement that aligns with the specific details in the Premise.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because being convicted of trafficking marijuana (an illegal activity) and being jailed for 20 years implies that she was caught and imprisoned for something illegal.

   - Consequence: Jailed for 20 years

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Schapelle Corby was convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali.
   - The Hypothesis states that Schapelle Corby was convicted of removing marijuana from Bali.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are opposite in direction: ""trafficking into Bali"" vs. ""removing from Bali.""
   - These actions cannot both be true simultaneously because they describe fundamentally different activities (bringing in vs. taking out).
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Given this analysis, the correct relation is:

**Premise:** Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali and jailed for 20 years.

**Hypothesis:** Australian Schapelle Corby was jailed for 20 years because he was convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali.

1. **Subject Consistency:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis refer to ""Australian Schapelle Corby.""

2. **Action Consistency:**
   - The Premise states that Schapelle Corby was ""convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali.""
   - The Hypothesis states that Schapelle Corby was ""convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali.""

3. **Outcome Consistency:**
   - The Premise states that Schapelle Corby was ""jailed for 20 years.""
   - The Hypothesis states that Schapelle Corby was ""jailed for 20 years.""

4. **Causal Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states the reason for the jail sentence: ""because he was convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali.""
   - The Premise implies the same causal relationship without explicitly stating ""because.""

5. **Pronoun Consistency:**
   - The Premise uses ""Schapelle Corby"" without specifying gender.
   - The Hypothesis uses ""he,"" which is a minor inconsistency since Schapelle Corby is female. However, this does not affect the logical relationship between the statements.

Given that the Hypothesis restates the information in the Premise with a minor pronoun inconsistency but maintains the same logical relationship and factual content, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

**Conclusion:**
The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

   - Key information: The man was allowed to stay in the United Kingdom on the same date (070713).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the man was deported to the United Kingdom, which implies that he was sent out of a country to the United Kingdom.
   - The Hypothesis states that the man was allowed to stay in the United Kingdom, which implies that he was permitted to remain in the United Kingdom.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the man was deported to the United Kingdom, it means he was sent there, likely from another country.
   - If the man was allowed to stay in the United Kingdom, it means he was permitted to remain there, which contradicts the idea of being deported (sent away).

Since being deported to a country and being allowed to stay in that country are mutually exclusive actions, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,Kevin lifted the trumpet and filled the room with happy noise.,Kevin lifted the trumpet and played to an audience that filled the room.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""Kevin lifted the trumpet and filled the room with happy noise.""
   - This indicates that Kevin did something with the trumpet that resulted in the room being filled with happy noise. It implies that Kevin played the trumpet, but it does not specify the presence of an audience.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""Kevin lifted the trumpet and played to an audience that filled the room.""
   - This statement suggests that Kevin not only played the trumpet but also did so in front of an audience that filled the room.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise confirms that Kevin lifted the trumpet and produced happy noise, but it does not mention an audience.
   - The Hypothesis adds the detail of an audience filling the room, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Determination:**
   - **Entailment (0):** For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to confirm the Hypothesis as definitely true. Since the Premise does not mention an audience, we cannot confirm the Hypothesis solely based on the Premise.
   - **Neutral (1):** The Hypothesis could be true or false based on the Premise. The Premise does not provide information about the presence or absence of an audience, so the Hypothesis remains a possibility.
   - **Contradiction (2):** For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that directly negates the Hypothesis. Since the Premise does not mention anything that would make the presence of an audience impossible, there is no direct contradiction.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""Kevin lifted the trumpet and filled the room with happy noise.""
   - This indicates that Kevin played the trumpet, which produced a happy noise that filled the room.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""Kevin lowered the trumpet and filled the room with silence.""
   - This suggests that Kevin stopped playing the trumpet, resulting in silence filling the room.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise describes an action (lifting the trumpet) that results in a happy noise.
   - The Hypothesis describes an opposite action (lowering the trumpet) that results in silence.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are opposites (lifting vs. lowering the trumpet).
   - The outcomes described in the Premise and Hypothesis are also opposites (happy noise vs. silence).
   - Given that the Premise states Kevin lifted the trumpet and produced noise, it directly contradicts the Hypothesis that Kevin lowered the trumpet and produced silence.

Based on this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. Therefore, the relation is:

   - The premise states: ""Dude has filled the room with flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.""
   - Key elements: ""Dude"" (a colloquial term for a man), ""filled the room"" (action), ""flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards"" (items).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""A man filled the room with sweet things for his significant other.""
   - Key elements: ""A man"" (subject), ""filled the room"" (action), ""sweet things"" (items), ""for his significant other"" (purpose).

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Subject**: ""Dude"" in the premise is equivalent to ""A man"" in the hypothesis.
   - **Action**: Both the premise and the hypothesis describe the action of filling the room.
   - **Items**: The premise specifies ""flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards,"" which can be considered ""sweet things"" in a broader sense.
   - **Purpose**: The premise does not explicitly state the purpose, but the items mentioned (flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards) are commonly associated with romantic gestures, which aligns with the hypothesis's implication of doing it ""for his significant other.""

4. **Inference**:
   - The hypothesis generalizes the items as ""sweet things"" and adds the purpose ""for his significant other,"" which is a reasonable inference given the context of the items mentioned in the premise.
   - There is no information in the premise that contradicts the hypothesis.
   - The hypothesis is a plausible and reasonable interpretation of the premise.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Dude has filled the room with flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.""
   - This means that the room is currently full of these items.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Dude has emptied the room of flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.""
   - This means that the room currently has none of these items.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the room is full of flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that the room is empty of these items.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If the room is full of these items (Premise), it cannot simultaneously be empty of these items (Hypothesis).
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Dude has filled the room with flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.""
   - This means that the room is now full of these items, implying that the items have been brought into the room and arranged in such a way that the room is filled with them.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Dude has moved flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards into the room.""
   - This means that the items have been transported into the room, but it does not specify the extent to which the room is filled or how the items are arranged.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise implies a more specific scenario where the room is filled with the items.
   - The Hypothesis only states that the items have been moved into the room, which is a necessary condition for the room to be filled with them but does not guarantee that the room is filled.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a less specific statement compared to the Premise. The action of moving the items into the room is a prerequisite for filling the room with them.
   - Therefore, if the room is filled with the items (Premise), it must be true that the items were moved into the room (Hypothesis).

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

     - There is a grand crystal chandelier.
     - The chandelier is in a room.
     - The chandelier is displayed in the center of the room.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis mention a chandelier in a room.
   - The premise describes the chandelier as ""enormous"" and creating a ""stunning display of reflected light.""
   - The hypothesis describes the chandelier as ""grand"" and ""crystal,"" and specifies its location as the center of the room.

4. **Inference**:
   - The premise does not specify the material of the chandelier (crystal) or its exact location (center of the room).
   - The hypothesis adds details that are not explicitly mentioned in the premise but are not necessarily contradictory.
   - The chandelier being ""enormous"" and creating a ""stunning display of reflected light"" could imply it is grand and possibly crystal, but this is not certain.
   - The location of the chandelier in the center of the room is not confirmed or denied by the premise.

Given these points, the hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the premise. There is no direct contradiction, but the additional details in the hypothesis are not confirmed by the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,"Freshly ground coffee beans filled the room with a seductive, earthy aroma.","Stale whole coffee beans filled the room with an unattractive, otherworldly scent.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Freshly ground coffee beans filled the room with a seductive, earthy aroma.""
   - Key points:
     - The coffee beans are freshly ground.
     - The aroma is described as seductive and earthy.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Stale whole coffee beans filled the room with an unattractive, otherworldly scent.""
   - Key points:
     - The coffee beans are stale and whole.
     - The scent is described as unattractive and otherworldly.

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Freshness and Form**:
     - Premise: Freshly ground.
     - Hypothesis: Stale and whole.
   - **Aroma/Scent Description**:
     - Premise: Seductive and earthy.
     - Hypothesis: Unattractive and otherworldly.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The premise describes a scenario with freshly ground coffee beans and a positive aroma.
   - The hypothesis describes a scenario with stale whole coffee beans and a negative scent.
   - The descriptions of the coffee beans and their resulting aromas are fundamentally different in both freshness and the nature of the scent.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the premise, the hypothesis describes a situation that is not only different but also opposite in terms of the freshness and the quality of the aroma.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be true if the premise is true because the conditions and outcomes described are contradictory.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,"Freshly ground coffee beans filled the room with a seductive, earthy aroma.","The room was filled with a seductive, earthly aroma from freshly ground coffee beans.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Freshly ground coffee beans filled the room with a seductive, earthy aroma.""
   - This statement indicates that the aroma in the room is coming from freshly ground coffee beans and describes the aroma as ""seductive"" and ""earthy.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The room was filled with a seductive, earthly aroma from freshly ground coffee beans.""
   - This statement also indicates that the aroma in the room is coming from freshly ground coffee beans and describes the aroma as ""seductive"" and ""earthly.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same source of the aroma (freshly ground coffee beans).
   - Both describe the aroma with similar adjectives: ""seductive"" and ""earthy"" (note that ""earthly"" in the Hypothesis is likely a typographical error and should be ""earthy"" to match the Premise).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise with a slight rephrasing.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new elements that would make it uncertain or neutral.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the same information, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,The Grateful Dead have flooded the market with excellent live material.,The Grateful Dead have put out live recordings of their best concert that took place at a market flooded with fans.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""The Grateful Dead have flooded the market with excellent live material.""
   - This means that the Grateful Dead have released a large amount of high-quality live recordings.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""The Grateful Dead have put out live recordings of their best concert that took place at a market flooded with fans.""
   - This suggests that the Grateful Dead released recordings of a specific concert that was their best and took place at a market crowded with fans.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise talks about the general release of excellent live material by the Grateful Dead.
   - The Hypothesis talks about a specific concert recording that was the best and took place at a market crowded with fans.

4. **Inference Determination:**
   - The Premise does not specify any particular concert or the conditions of the concert (e.g., being the best or taking place at a market with fans).
   - The Hypothesis introduces specific details that are not mentioned in the Premise.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the specific details in the Hypothesis.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

   - This means that the Grateful Dead have released a large amount of high-quality live recordings.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The Grateful Dead have not released any good live material on the market.""
   - This means that the Grateful Dead have not released any high-quality live recordings.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise asserts that there is a large quantity of excellent live material released by the Grateful Dead.
   - The Hypothesis asserts that there is no good live material released by the Grateful Dead.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - If the Premise is true (i.e., there is a large amount of excellent live material), then the Hypothesis (i.e., no good live material) cannot be true.
   - The statements are directly contradictory because the existence of ""excellent live material"" directly opposes the claim of ""not released any good live material.""

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

causative-with-CxN,partial,Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.,"Samsung has flooded the market with tasteful, funny ads.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.""
   - This means that Samsung has extensively advertised their products.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Samsung has flooded the market with tasteful, funny ads.""
   - This means that the advertisements are described as ""tasteful"" and ""funny.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise does not provide any information about the nature or quality of the advertisements. It only mentions the quantity or extent of the advertising.
   - The hypothesis adds additional information by describing the advertisements as ""tasteful"" and ""funny.""

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the premise does not specify whether the ads are tasteful or funny, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise alone.
   - The hypothesis introduces new information that is not addressed in the premise, making it possible but not certain.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

   - The premise states: ""Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.""
   - This implies that Samsung has extensively and aggressively advertised their products.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Samsung has held back with their advertising.""
   - This implies that Samsung has been restrained or conservative in their advertising efforts.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise suggests a high level of advertising activity (""flooded the market"").
   - The hypothesis suggests a low level of advertising activity (""held back"").

4. **Inference**:
   - The two statements are directly opposing each other. If Samsung has flooded the market with advertising, it cannot simultaneously be true that they have held back with their advertising.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.""
   - Key points:
     - Saudi Arabia took an action (flooding the market with cheap oil).
     - The purpose of this action was to recover their market share.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that ""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil that was sold to at least five countries.""
   - Key points:
     - Saudi Arabia took an action (flooding the market with cheap oil).
     - The oil was sold to at least five countries.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap oil.
   - The Premise does not specify the number of countries to which the oil was sold.
   - The Hypothesis adds a specific detail that the oil was sold to at least five countries, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information (the oil being sold to at least five countries) that is not present in the Premise.
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the specific detail about the number of countries.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.,Saudi reduced the market's supply of cheap oil so they could deteriorate their market share.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.""
   - This means that Saudi Arabia increased the supply of cheap oil in the market with the intention of recovering or increasing their market share.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Saudi reduced the market's supply of cheap oil so they could deteriorate their market share.""
   - This means that Saudi Arabia decreased the supply of cheap oil in the market with the intention of reducing or deteriorating their market share.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Saudi Arabia increased the supply of cheap oil to recover their market share.
   - The Hypothesis states that Saudi Arabia decreased the supply of cheap oil to deteriorate their market share.

4. **Contradiction Check**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are opposite: increasing supply vs. decreasing supply.
   - The intentions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are also opposite: recovering market share vs. deteriorating market share.

Given these points, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise in both the action taken (flooding the market vs. reducing supply) and the intended outcome (recovering market share vs. deteriorating market share).

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.,"To recover their market share, Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.""
   - This statement indicates that Saudi Arabia's action of flooding the market with cheap oil was done with the intention of recovering their market share.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""To recover their market share, Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil.""
   - This statement suggests that the reason Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap oil was to recover their market share.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: Saudi Arabia flooding the market with cheap oil.
   - Both statements also attribute the same purpose to this action: recovering their market share.
   - The difference is in the structure of the sentences, but the meaning conveyed is identical.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise with the same meaning and intent, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.,"The Chinese have the largest, juiciest apples on the market.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.""
   - This means that the Chinese have introduced a large quantity of apples suitable for making juice into the market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The Chinese have the largest, juiciest apples on the market.""
   - This implies that the Chinese apples are not only abundant but also the largest and juiciest available.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise focuses on the quantity and type (juice-grade) of apples the Chinese have introduced to the market.
   - The Hypothesis makes a qualitative claim about the size and juiciness of the apples.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise would need to provide information about the size and juiciness of the apples, which it does not.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the size and juiciness of the apples. It only mentions the quantity and type (juice-grade), which does not directly relate to the largest and juiciest apples.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: There is no information in the Premise that directly contradicts the Hypothesis. The Premise does not state that the apples are not large or juicy.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.,The Chinese already have under produced in the market with juice-grade apples.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.""
   - This means that there is an abundance or oversupply of juice-grade apples in the market due to Chinese production.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The Chinese already have under produced in the market with juice-grade apples.""
   - This means that there is a shortage or insufficient supply of juice-grade apples in the market due to Chinese production.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that there is an oversupply (""flooded the market"").
   - The Hypothesis states that there is an undersupply (""under produced"").

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The two statements are directly contradictory. If the market is flooded with juice-grade apples, it cannot simultaneously be under produced. These two conditions cannot coexist.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

causative-with-CxN,partial,The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.,Juice-grade apples have already been flooded in the market by the Chinese.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.""
   - This statement indicates that the Chinese have introduced a large quantity of juice-grade apples into the market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Juice-grade apples have already been flooded in the market by the Chinese.""
   - This statement is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. It conveys the same information: the Chinese have introduced a large quantity of juice-grade apples into the market.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same event: the Chinese flooding the market with juice-grade apples.
   - The only difference is the structure of the sentences, but the meaning remains unchanged.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the same information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.,He turned his face to the wall and covered it out of embarrassment.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each component step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.""
   - This sentence describes an action where someone turns to face the wall and then covers their face with a pillow.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He turned his face to the wall and covered it out of embarrassment.""
   - This sentence describes a similar action but adds a reason for the action, specifically stating that it was done out of embarrassment.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the action of turning to the wall and covering the face.
   - The Premise does not provide any reason for the action.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a specific reason: embarrassment.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must definitively imply the Hypothesis. In this case, the Premise does not provide any information about the reason for the action, so it cannot definitively imply that the action was done out of embarrassment.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise describes the action but does not specify the reason, so it is possible that the action was done out of embarrassment, but it is also possible that it was done for another reason.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must definitively rule out the Hypothesis. The Premise does not provide any information that contradicts the possibility of embarrassment being the reason for the action.

Given that the Premise does not provide any information about the reason for the action, the Hypothesis may or may not be true. Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.,Turning away fromt he wall he uncovered his face with a pillow.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.""
   - This means the subject is facing the wall and has placed a pillow over their face.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""Turning away from the wall he uncovered his face with a pillow.""
   - This means the subject is facing away from the wall and has removed the pillow from their face.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise states that the subject is facing the wall and has their face covered with a pillow.
   - The Hypothesis states that the subject is facing away from the wall and has their face uncovered.

4. **Inference Determination:**
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis are directly opposite to those described in the Premise.
   - In the Premise, the subject is facing the wall and covering their face.
   - In the Hypothesis, the subject is facing away from the wall and uncovering their face.

Given these observations, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because the actions and orientations described are contradictory.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.,He covered his face with a pillow as he turned toward the wall.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.""
   - This statement describes two actions: turning to the wall and covering his face with a pillow. The sequence of actions is that he turns to the wall first and then covers his face with a pillow.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He covered his face with a pillow as he turned toward the wall.""
   - This statement suggests that the action of covering his face with a pillow happens simultaneously with turning toward the wall.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a sequence where turning to the wall happens first, followed by covering his face with a pillow.
   - The Hypothesis suggests simultaneity, implying that both actions occur at the same time.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state that the actions are simultaneous; it implies a sequence.
   - The Hypothesis suggests simultaneity, which is not explicitly supported by the Premise.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the simultaneity of the actions.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The school filled his head with knowledge.
   - The school challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The school imparted pertinent, real-world knowledge.
   - The school challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that the school challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.
   - The difference lies in the description of the knowledge imparted:
     - The Premise states that the school filled his head with knowledge.
     - The Hypothesis specifies that the knowledge was pertinent and real-world.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not specify the nature of the knowledge (whether it is pertinent or real-world), only that it filled his head with knowledge.
   - The Hypothesis adds a specific quality to the knowledge (pertinent and real-world) that is not explicitly stated in the Premise.

Given that the Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis but also does not provide enough information to confirm the specific quality of the knowledge, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information given in the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

   - The school challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The school emptied his head of knowledge.
   - The school eased him with tests, quizzes, and homework.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the school filled his head with knowledge, which implies an increase in knowledge.
   - The Hypothesis states that the school emptied his head of knowledge, which implies a decrease or removal of knowledge.
   - These two statements are directly opposite in meaning regarding the effect on his knowledge.

   - The Premise states that the school challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework, which implies difficulty and effort.
   - The Hypothesis states that the school eased him with tests, quizzes, and homework, which implies making things easier or less challenging.
   - These two statements are also directly opposite in meaning regarding the nature of tests, quizzes, and homework.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise in both aspects (knowledge and the nature of tests, quizzes, and homework), the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.""
   - This statement suggests that Susan deceived someone and manipulated them with false information. It does not provide any information about Susan's profession or trade.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Susan was a trapper by trade, specializing in mink hats.""
   - This statement suggests that Susan's profession is trapping animals, specifically for making mink hats. It implies a specific job and skill set.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about Susan's actions in a metaphorical or deceptive context, not about her profession.
   - The Hypothesis makes a specific claim about Susan's profession, which is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.

4. **Inference**:
   - There is no information in the Premise that confirms or denies Susan's profession as a trapper specializing in mink hats.
   - The Premise does not provide enough context to determine whether the Hypothesis is true or false.

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""Susan trapped him"": This indicates that Susan confined or restricted him in some way.
   - ""filled his head with lies"": This suggests that Susan deceived him by telling him false information.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""Susan let him free"": This indicates that Susan released him from confinement or restriction.
   - ""cleared his head of lies"": This suggests that Susan removed the false information she had previously given him.

3. **Comparing Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The Premise states that Susan trapped him and filled his head with lies.
   - The Hypothesis states that Susan let him free and cleared his head of lies.

4. **Inference Determination:**
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis are directly opposite to those described in the Premise.
   - If Susan trapped him, she did not let him free.
   - If Susan filled his head with lies, she did not clear his head of lies.

Given these points, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

causative-with-CxN,partial,"Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.","Susan filled his head with lies, trapped him.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.""
   - This statement indicates two actions performed by Susan: she trapped him and filled his head with lies.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Susan filled his head with lies, trapped him.""
   - This statement also indicates the same two actions performed by Susan: she filled his head with lies and trapped him.

3. **Order of Actions**:
   - The order of actions in the Premise is: trapped him first, then filled his head with lies.
   - The order of actions in the Hypothesis is: filled his head with lies first, then trapped him.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in both the Premise and the Hypothesis are the same, but the order in which they are mentioned is different.
   - The difference in order does not change the truth value of the actions themselves. Both actions are still performed by Susan regardless of the sequence in which they are mentioned.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the Hypothesis describes the same actions as the Premise, just in a different order, the Hypothesis is still definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,"They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.",They made him take pills that were supposed to ease his headache.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information provided in each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""They made him take pills"" indicates that someone was compelled to take medication.
   - ""that filled his head with cold, silent noise"" describes the effect of the pills, which is unusual and negative, suggesting discomfort or an adverse reaction.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""They made him take pills"" is consistent with the Premise, as it also indicates someone was compelled to take medication.
   - ""that were supposed to ease his headache"" suggests the intended purpose of the pills was to relieve a headache, which is a positive and beneficial effect.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise describes the actual effect of the pills as filling his head with ""cold, silent noise,"" which implies a negative or adverse effect.
   - The Hypothesis describes the intended purpose of the pills as easing a headache, which implies a positive effect.

4. **Inference Determination:**
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis describe different effects of the pills: the Premise describes an adverse effect, while the Hypothesis describes a beneficial intended purpose.
   - The Premise does not provide any information that confirms the pills were intended to ease a headache. It only describes the actual negative effect.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the intended purpose of the pills.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,"They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.","They made him give away pills that emptied his head of cold, silent noise.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""They made him take pills"" indicates that someone forced him to ingest pills.
   - ""that filled his head with cold, silent noise"" describes the effect of the pills, which is to fill his head with a sensation of cold, silent noise.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""They made him give away pills"" indicates that someone forced him to distribute or hand over pills to others.
   - ""that emptied his head of cold, silent noise"" describes the effect of the pills, which is to remove the sensation of cold, silent noise from his head.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are different: taking pills vs. giving away pills.
   - The effects described in the Premise and Hypothesis are opposite: filling his head with noise vs. emptying his head of noise.

4. **Inference Determination:**
   - The Premise states that the pills caused his head to be filled with cold, silent noise.
   - The Hypothesis states that the pills caused his head to be emptied of cold, silent noise.
   - These two effects are contradictory because the same pills cannot both fill and empty his head of the same sensation.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,"They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.","His head was filled with cold, silent noise from pills they made him take.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.""
   - This sentence states that ""they"" (unspecified people) forced ""him"" (unspecified person) to take pills, and as a result, his head was filled with ""cold, silent noise.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""His head was filled with cold, silent noise from pills they made him take.""
   - This sentence states that his head was filled with ""cold, silent noise"" and attributes this effect to pills that ""they"" made him take.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: ""they"" made ""him"" take pills, and these pills caused his head to be filled with ""cold, silent noise.""
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.,"There are other teachers, but one was trying to conceal her body with a sheet.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information provided in both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.""
   - This indicates that there is at least one teacher who took action to cover someone's body with a black sheet.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""There are other teachers, but one was trying to conceal her body with a sheet.""
   - This suggests that there are multiple teachers, and one specific teacher was attempting to conceal her body with a sheet.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise mentions ""one of the teachers,"" which implies the existence of more than one teacher, aligning with the hypothesis's mention of ""other teachers.""
   - The action described in the premise (""covered her body with a black sheet"") is consistent with the hypothesis's description of a teacher ""trying to conceal her body with a sheet.""

4. **Inference**:
   - The hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the premise.
   - The hypothesis is a plausible interpretation of the premise, as it does not state anything that would make the premise false.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise. Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.,One of the teachers left after removing a black sheet from her body.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.""
   - This means that a teacher approached and placed a black sheet over someone's body.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""One of the teachers left after removing a black sheet from her body.""
   - This suggests that a teacher departed after taking a black sheet off someone's body.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an action where a teacher covers a body with a black sheet.
   - The Hypothesis describes an action where a teacher removes a black sheet from a body and then leaves.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are opposite in nature. The Premise involves covering a body with a black sheet, while the Hypothesis involves removing a black sheet from a body.
   - Since the actions are contradictory (covering vs. removing), the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.,One of the teachers covered her body with a black sheet after she came along.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information provided in each statement and compare them step by step.

### Premise:
""One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.""

- **Action**: A teacher covered her body with a black sheet.
- **Sequence**: The teacher came along first, then covered her body with a black sheet.

### Hypothesis:
""One of the teachers covered her body with a black sheet after she came along.""

- **Action**: A teacher covered her body with a black sheet.
- **Sequence**: The teacher came along first, then covered her body with a black sheet.

### Comparison:
1. **Action**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action: a teacher covering her body with a black sheet.
2. **Sequence**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of events: the teacher came along first, then covered her body with a black sheet.

### Conclusion:
Since the Hypothesis restates the sequence and action described in the Premise without adding any new information or altering the meaning, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,Howze filled her house with music and color.,Howze was the best roommate she had ever had.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information provided in each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Howze filled her house with music and color.""
   - This indicates that Howze has a positive influence on the environment of the house by adding music and color.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Howze was the best roommate she had ever had.""
   - This is a subjective statement about Howze being the best roommate, which implies a high level of satisfaction with Howze as a roommate.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides specific actions that Howze took (filling the house with music and color), which could contribute to someone perceiving Howze as a good roommate.
   - However, the Premise does not provide any direct information about Howze being the best roommate. It only describes certain positive actions.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true, the Premise would need to explicitly state that Howze was the best roommate. The Premise does not provide this level of certainty.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Premise provides positive information about Howze, which could support the Hypothesis, but it does not definitively confirm it. The Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: There is no information in the Premise that directly contradicts the Hypothesis. The Premise does not state anything that would make the Hypothesis impossible.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,Howze filled her house with music and color.,Howze emptied her house of music and color.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Howze filled her house with music and color.""
   - This means that Howze added music and color to her house, making it full of these elements.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Howze emptied her house of music and color.""
   - This means that Howze removed music and color from her house, making it devoid of these elements.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates that music and color were added to the house.
   - The hypothesis indicates that music and color were removed from the house.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the premise and the hypothesis are directly opposite to each other.
   - If Howze filled her house with music and color, it cannot be true that she emptied her house of music and color at the same time.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Howze filled her house with music and color.,The house was filled with music and color by Howze.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Howze filled her house with music and color.""
   - This means that Howze is the agent who performed the action of filling her house with music and color.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The house was filled with music and color by Howze.""
   - This is a passive construction of the same action described in the Premise. It indicates that the house was filled with music and color, and the agent performing the action is Howze.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: Howze filling her house with music and color.
   - The only difference is the grammatical structure: the Premise uses an active voice, while the Hypothesis uses a passive voice.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is simply a rephrasing of the Premise and conveys the exact same information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.,The red wine bottle was opened by him and he poured her a glass full of it.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information provided in both statements step by step.

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""The cork came out with a pleasant pop"" suggests that a bottle, likely a wine bottle, was opened.
   - ""He filled her glass with the rich red liquid"" indicates that the liquid poured into the glass is red and likely a beverage.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""The red wine bottle was opened by him"" directly states that a red wine bottle was opened by a male individual.
   - ""He poured her a glass full of it"" indicates that the same individual poured the red wine into her glass.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise describes the action of opening a bottle with a cork and pouring a red liquid into a glass.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that the bottle is a red wine bottle and that the liquid poured is red wine.

4. **Inference:**
   - The Premise does not explicitly state that the bottle is a red wine bottle, but it strongly implies it through the description of the cork popping and the red liquid.
   - The Hypothesis makes this implication explicit by stating it is a red wine bottle and that the liquid poured is red wine.

Given the strong implication in the Premise that aligns with the explicit statement in the Hypothesis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.,The cork came out with a horrible pop and he emptied her glass of the rich red liquid.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The cork came out with a pleasant pop"" indicates a positive experience with the cork coming out.
   - ""He filled her glass with the rich red liquid"" suggests that the glass was empty before and is now filled with a red liquid, likely wine.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The cork came out with a horrible pop"" indicates a negative experience with the cork coming out, which is in direct contrast to the ""pleasant pop"" in the Premise.
   - ""He emptied her glass of the rich red liquid"" suggests that the glass was full and is now empty, which is the opposite action of filling the glass as stated in the Premise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The description of the cork coming out is directly contradictory: ""pleasant pop"" vs. ""horrible pop"".
   - The action regarding the glass is also directly contradictory: ""filled her glass"" vs. ""emptied her glass"".

Given these direct contradictions in both the description of the cork and the action involving the glass, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.,He filled her glass with the rich red liquid that came from opening the cork with a pleasant pop.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the content step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The cork came out with a pleasant pop"" indicates that a cork was removed, and it made a pleasant sound.
   - ""He filled her glass with the rich red liquid"" indicates that after the cork was removed, he poured a rich red liquid into her glass.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He filled her glass with the rich red liquid that came from opening the cork with a pleasant pop"" suggests that the rich red liquid he poured into her glass came from the bottle that was opened with a pleasant pop.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the cork came out with a pleasant pop and then he filled her glass with a rich red liquid.
   - The Hypothesis adds the detail that the rich red liquid came from the bottle that was opened with the pleasant pop.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise, as it is reasonable to infer that the rich red liquid came from the bottle that was opened with the pleasant pop.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,The waiter filled her glass with white wine.,She ordered the white wine in a glass.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The waiter filled her glass with white wine.""
   - This statement tells us that a waiter poured white wine into a glass that belongs to a female individual.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She ordered the white wine in a glass.""
   - This statement suggests that the female individual requested white wine to be served in a glass.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about whether the female individual ordered the white wine. It only states that the waiter filled her glass with white wine.
   - The Hypothesis introduces the idea that she ordered the white wine, which is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to conclude that the Hypothesis is definitely true. In this case, the Premise does not confirm that she ordered the white wine.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny that she ordered the white wine.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that directly conflicts with the Hypothesis. There is no such conflict here.

Given the analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as Neutral.

Answer: 1",Answer: 1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,The waiter filled her glass with white wine.,The waiter emptied her glass of white wine.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The waiter filled her glass with white wine.""
   - This means that the glass, which was presumably empty or not full, is now filled with white wine by the waiter.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The waiter emptied her glass of white wine.""
   - This means that the glass, which had white wine in it, is now emptied by the waiter.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise states that the glass is filled with white wine.
   - The Hypothesis states that the glass is emptied of white wine.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If the glass is filled with white wine, it cannot simultaneously be emptied of white wine. These two actions are mutually exclusive and cannot happen at the same time.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

The correct numerical value is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,The waiter filled her glass with white wine.,Her glass was filled with white wine by the waiter.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The statement is: ""The waiter filled her glass with white wine.""
   - This means that there is a waiter who performed the action of filling a glass that belongs to a female (her) with white wine.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The statement is: ""Her glass was filled with white wine by the waiter.""
   - This is a passive construction of the same action described in the premise. It indicates that the glass belonging to a female was filled with white wine, and the action was performed by a waiter.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: a waiter filling a glass with white wine.
   - The only difference is the structure of the sentences: the Premise uses an active voice, while the Hypothesis uses a passive voice.
   - The content and meaning of both statements are identical.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they describe the same event in different grammatical structures), the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct numerical value for the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.,"After filling her pockets with rocks, Virginia Woolf walked into a river famous for its clear waters.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information provided in each statement step by step.

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - The Premise states that ""Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.""
   - This provides two key pieces of information:
     - Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks.
     - Virginia Woolf walked into a river.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - The Hypothesis states that ""After filling her pockets with rocks, Virginia Woolf walked into a river famous for its clear waters.""
   - This also provides two key pieces of information:
     - Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks.
     - Virginia Woolf walked into a river famous for its clear waters.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.
   - The additional detail in the Hypothesis is that the river is ""famous for its clear waters."" This detail is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information (the river being famous for its clear waters) that is not present in the Premise.
   - The new information does not contradict the Premise; it is an additional detail that could be true or false.
   - Since the Premise does not provide any information about the clarity or fame of the river's waters, we cannot definitively determine the truth of the Hypothesis based on the Premise alone.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.,Virginia Woolf emptied her pockets of rocks and walked away from the river.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.""
   - This statement indicates that Virginia Woolf took an action of filling her pockets with rocks and then proceeded to walk into a river.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Virginia Woolf emptied her pockets of rocks and walked away from the river.""
   - This statement suggests that Virginia Woolf took an action of emptying her pockets of rocks and then walked away from the river.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes Virginia Woolf walking into the river with rocks in her pockets.
   - The Hypothesis describes Virginia Woolf walking away from the river after emptying her pockets of rocks.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are directly opposite. In the Premise, she is moving towards the river with rocks, while in the Hypothesis, she is moving away from the river without rocks.
   - These actions cannot both be true simultaneously because they describe mutually exclusive scenarios.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Final Answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.,Virginia Woolf walked into a river after filling her pockets with rocks.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.""
   - This indicates two actions performed by Virginia Woolf: 
     1. She filled her pockets with rocks.
     2. She walked into a river.
   - The use of ""and"" suggests that these actions are sequential but does not specify the exact order explicitly.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Virginia Woolf walked into a river after filling her pockets with rocks.""
   - This indicates the same two actions but specifies the order explicitly:
     1. She filled her pockets with rocks.
     2. She walked into a river.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same two actions performed by Virginia Woolf.
   - The Premise uses ""and"" which implies a sequence but does not contradict the order given in the Hypothesis.
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states the order of actions, which is consistent with the sequence implied by the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a more explicit restatement of the sequence implied in the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.,Blizzards can be fun for children playing in the snow.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.""
   - This indicates that a blizzard occurred and it was severe enough to cover people with snow.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Blizzards can be fun for children playing in the snow.""
   - This suggests that blizzards have the potential to be enjoyable for children who are playing in the snow.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise describes a specific situation where a blizzard is intense enough to cover bodies with snow, implying a potentially dangerous or severe condition.
   - The hypothesis makes a general statement about the potential enjoyment children might find in blizzards.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be an entailment, the premise must provide definitive evidence that blizzards are fun for children. The premise does not provide this evidence; it only describes a severe blizzard.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis could be true or false regardless of the premise. The premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the general enjoyment children might find in blizzards.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the hypothesis to be a contradiction, the premise must directly refute the idea that blizzards can be fun for children. The premise does not directly refute this; it simply describes a severe blizzard without addressing children's enjoyment.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the final answer is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.,A blizzard soon took snow away from their bodies.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.""
   - This means that a blizzard caused snow to accumulate on their bodies.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""A blizzard soon took snow away from their bodies.""
   - This means that a blizzard caused snow to be removed from their bodies.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the blizzard caused snow to cover their bodies.
   - The Hypothesis states that the blizzard caused snow to be taken away from their bodies.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are directly opposite to each other.
   - If the Premise is true (the blizzard covered their bodies with snow), then the Hypothesis (the blizzard took snow away from their bodies) cannot be true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.,Their bodies were soon covered with snow from the blizzard.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.""
   - This statement indicates that a blizzard occurred and as a result, snow covered their bodies.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Their bodies were soon covered with snow from the blizzard.""
   - This statement indicates that their bodies were covered with snow, and the source of the snow is specified as the blizzard.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: a blizzard causing snow to cover their bodies.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.
   - The temporal aspect (""soon"") and the causal relationship (snow from the blizzard) are consistent in both statements.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and does not add or contradict any information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

comparative-correlative,partial,"The harder they come, the harder they fall.",They are likely to be injured if they fall hard.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The harder they come, the harder they fall.""
   - This is a proverbial statement suggesting that those who rise to power or prominence quickly and forcefully are likely to experience a significant downfall.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""They are likely to be injured if they fall hard.""
   - This statement suggests that a hard fall is likely to result in injury.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about the severity of the fall being proportional to the rise, but it does not explicitly mention injury.
   - The Hypothesis introduces the concept of injury as a consequence of a hard fall.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not provide information about injury; it only discusses the severity of the fall.
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise because the Premise does not address the likelihood of injury.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is not definitively true or false based on the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The harder they come, the harder they fall.",How hard they fall is dependent on their actions.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The harder they come, the harder they fall.""
   - This statement suggests a direct correlation between the difficulty or intensity with which someone or something approaches a situation and the severity of the consequences they face.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""How hard they fall is dependent on their actions.""
   - This statement suggests that the severity of the consequences (how hard they fall) is influenced by their actions.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise implies a direct relationship between the intensity of the approach and the severity of the fall.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that the severity of the fall is influenced by actions, which can be interpreted as a broader or different set of factors than just the intensity of the approach.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state that actions are the determining factor for the severity of the fall; it focuses on the intensity of the approach.
   - The Hypothesis introduces the idea that actions (which could include intensity but also other factors) determine the severity of the fall.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is not directly entailed by the Premise, as the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the role of actions in determining the fall's severity.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The harder they come, the harder they fall.",They will fall softly regardless of how hard they come at me.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The harder they come, the harder they fall.""
- This statement suggests a direct correlation between the intensity of an action and its consequence. Specifically, it implies that if something or someone approaches with great force or intensity, the resulting fall or failure will be equally intense.

Hypothesis: ""They will fall softly regardless of how hard they come at me.""
- This statement suggests that the fall will be soft no matter the intensity of the approach. It directly contradicts the idea that a harder approach results in a harder fall.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:
1. **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, it must be definitely true given the Premise. However, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.
2. **Neutral (1)**: For the Hypothesis to be neutral, it must be possible but not necessarily true given the Premise. The Hypothesis is not neutral because it directly opposes the Premise.
3. **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, it must be impossible given the Premise. The Hypothesis states that the fall will be soft regardless of the intensity, which is the opposite of what the Premise suggests.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
comparative-correlative,partial,"The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.",He has a very annoying voice.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.""
   - This statement suggests that the presence of ""he"" causes increasing misery over time.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He has a very annoying voice.""
   - This statement provides a specific reason for why ""he"" might be annoying, focusing on his voice.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about a general increase in misery due to ""he"" being around.
   - The Hypothesis gives a specific characteristic (an annoying voice) that could potentially contribute to the misery mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis does not directly confirm or deny the general statement in the Premise. It provides additional information that could be a reason for the misery but does not definitively establish the relationship.
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not specify the cause of misery, so the annoying voice could be one of many possible reasons.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.","If he is around longer today, I will probably not enjoy myself.",0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.""
- This statement indicates a direct correlation between the duration of someone's presence and the speaker's level of misery. The longer the person is around, the more miserable the speaker becomes.

Hypothesis: ""If he is around longer today, I will probably not enjoy myself.""
- This statement suggests that if the person is around for a longer period today, the speaker will likely not have a good time.

Now, let's compare the two statements:

1. **Consistency of Information**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker's misery increases with the duration of the person's presence.
   - The Hypothesis states that if the person is around longer today, the speaker will probably not enjoy themselves.

2. **Logical Connection**:
   - If the speaker becomes more miserable the longer the person is around (Premise), it logically follows that if the person is around longer today, the speaker will likely not enjoy themselves (Hypothesis).

3. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the Premise. If the speaker's misery increases with the person's presence, it is logical to conclude that a longer presence today would result in the speaker not enjoying themselves.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.",I'm happiest on the days where he is around a lot.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.""
   - This means that the presence of ""he"" for a longer duration directly correlates with an increase in the speaker's misery.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I'm happiest on the days where he is around a lot.""
   - This means that the presence of ""he"" for a longer duration directly correlates with an increase in the speaker's happiness.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker becomes more miserable the longer ""he"" is around.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker is happiest when ""he"" is around a lot.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis present directly opposing statements about the speaker's emotional state in relation to ""he"" being around.
   - If the Premise is true, the Hypothesis cannot be true because they describe opposite emotional outcomes for the same situation.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more I studied, the less I understood.",I studied a lot for my recent exams.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The more I studied, the less I understood.""
Hypothesis: ""I studied a lot for my recent exams.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise suggests a negative correlation between studying and understanding. It implies that increased studying led to decreased understanding.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that the speaker studied a lot for their recent exams. It does not make any claim about the outcome of that studying (whether it led to better or worse understanding).

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise does not directly state the amount of studying, but it implies that there was a significant amount of studying since it mentions ""the more I studied.""
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states that the speaker studied a lot.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise would need to explicitly or implicitly confirm that the speaker studied a lot. The Premise does imply a significant amount of studying, but it does not explicitly confirm the exact amount.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise suggests a significant amount of studying, which aligns with the Hypothesis, but it does not provide enough information to definitively confirm the exact amount of studying.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Premise suggested that the speaker did not study a lot, which is not the case here.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more I studied, the less I understood.",I got more confused as I studied.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The more I studied, the less I understood.""
Hypothesis: ""I got more confused as I studied.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The Premise states that an increase in studying led to a decrease in understanding.
   - This implies a negative correlation between studying and understanding.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that studying led to an increase in confusion.
   - This implies a positive correlation between studying and confusion.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - Both statements describe the effect of studying.
   - The Premise indicates that more studying results in less understanding.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that more studying results in more confusion.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - If understanding decreases, it can be inferred that confusion increases, as understanding and confusion are generally inversely related.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise in terms of confusion instead of understanding.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

The correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more I studied, the less I understood.",I felt like my studying helped me really grasp the subject.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more I studied, the less I understood.""
   - This statement suggests a negative correlation between studying and understanding. The speaker is saying that increased studying led to decreased understanding.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I felt like my studying helped me really grasp the subject.""
   - This statement suggests a positive outcome from studying. The speaker feels that studying improved their understanding of the subject.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that studying more led to less understanding.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that studying led to better understanding.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis present opposite outcomes of studying. The Premise suggests a negative effect of studying on understanding, while the Hypothesis suggests a positive effect.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
comparative-correlative,partial,"It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.",This drug can be harmful for older patients.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.""
   - This statement suggests that the effectiveness of the drug decreases as the age of the patient increases. It does not provide any information about the drug being harmful, only that it becomes less effective.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""This drug can be harmful for older patients.""
   - This statement suggests that the drug has the potential to cause harm to older patients. It implies a negative effect beyond just reduced effectiveness.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about reduced effectiveness with age but does not mention harm.
   - The Hypothesis introduces the idea of harm, which is not supported or contradicted by the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide information about harm, we cannot definitively say that the Hypothesis is true or false based on the Premise alone.
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as the Premise only discusses effectiveness, not harm.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.",This drug is best suited for treating patients who are on the younger side.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.""
Hypothesis: ""This drug is best suited for treating patients who are on the younger side.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The effectiveness of the drug decreases as the age of the patient increases.
   - Therefore, the drug is more effective for younger patients.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The drug is best suited for younger patients.
   - This implies that the drug works better for younger patients compared to older ones.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise states that the drug is less effective for older patients, which implies it is more effective for younger patients.
   - The Hypothesis states that the drug is best suited for younger patients.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Hypothesis is directly supported by the information given in the Premise.
   - If the drug is less effective for older patients, it logically follows that it is more effective for younger patients, making the Hypothesis true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.",Ideally patients that take this drug are advanced in age.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.""
   - This suggests that the drug's effectiveness decreases as the patient's age increases.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Ideally patients that take this drug are advanced in age.""
   - This suggests that it is preferable for patients taking this drug to be older.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the drug is less effective for older patients.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that it is ideal for older patients to take this drug.

4. **Inference**:
   - There is a clear contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis. The Premise implies that the drug is less effective for older patients, while the Hypothesis suggests that older patients are the ideal candidates for the drug. These two statements cannot both be true simultaneously.

Therefore, the relation is:

comparative-correlative,partial,"Applied to health care, the longer we wait for it the worse off we are and the longer we put it off the longer it will take to fine tune it.",Waiting longer for healthcare will make it more expensive to implement.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that in the context of healthcare, waiting longer has negative consequences. Specifically, it mentions two points:
     - The longer we wait for healthcare, the worse off we are.
     - The longer we put off healthcare, the longer it will take to fine-tune it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis claims that waiting longer for healthcare will make it more expensive to implement.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise does not explicitly mention the cost of healthcare. It focuses on the negative outcomes of waiting, such as being worse off and taking longer to fine-tune.
   - The hypothesis introduces a new aspect (cost) that is not directly addressed in the premise.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - Since the premise does not provide information about the cost of healthcare, we cannot definitively conclude that waiting longer will make it more expensive based on the given premise.
   - The hypothesis is plausible but not guaranteed by the premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

### Premise:
""Applied to health care, the longer we wait for it the worse off we are and the longer we put it off the longer it will take to fine tune it.""

### Hypothesis:
""Putting off adequate healthcare will not serve the people's best interests.""

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The premise states that delaying healthcare has negative consequences. Specifically, it mentions that waiting longer for healthcare makes the situation worse and prolongs the time needed to improve or fine-tune the healthcare system.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis claims that delaying adequate healthcare is not beneficial for the people.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The premise suggests that delaying healthcare results in negative outcomes (""the worse off we are"" and ""the longer it will take to fine tune it"").
   - The hypothesis aligns with this by stating that delaying healthcare is not in the people's best interests, which is essentially another way of saying that it has negative consequences.

### Conclusion:
- The hypothesis is directly supported by the premise. The premise provides a reason why delaying healthcare is detrimental, which aligns with the hypothesis that delaying healthcare is not beneficial.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Applied to health care, the longer we wait for it the worse off we are and the longer we put it off the longer it will take to fine tune it.""
   - This means that delaying healthcare has negative consequences: it makes the situation worse and prolongs the time needed to improve it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""It's probably best to keep putting off applying healthcare reforms.""
   - This suggests that delaying healthcare reforms is a good idea.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that delaying healthcare is detrimental.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that delaying healthcare reforms is beneficial.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise indicates that delaying healthcare is harmful, while the Hypothesis suggests that delaying it is beneficial.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

comparative-correlative,partial,"The more bureaucrats run charities, the more people who need them.",Bureaucrats are always greedy.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""The more bureaucrats run charities, the more people who need them.""
   - This statement suggests a correlation between the number of bureaucrats running charities and an increase in the number of people who need the charities. It implies that having more bureaucrats in charge of charities might lead to inefficiencies or other issues that result in more people needing charitable assistance.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""Bureaucrats are always greedy.""
   - This statement makes a general claim about the nature of bureaucrats, specifically that they are always greedy.

3. **Relation Analysis**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide sufficient information to definitively conclude that bureaucrats are always greedy. The Premise does not provide any information about the personal characteristics or motivations of bureaucrats, only about the effect of their involvement in charities.
   - **Neutral (1)**: For the Hypothesis to be neutral, the Premise must neither support nor contradict the Hypothesis. The Premise discusses the impact of bureaucrats on charities but does not address their personal traits or greed. Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise alone.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that directly opposes the idea that bureaucrats are always greedy. The Premise does not provide any such information.

Given the analysis, the Premise does not provide enough information to either confirm or deny the Hypothesis. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is neutral.

**Final Answer**: 1",**Final Answer**: 1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more bureaucrats run charities, the more people who need them.",Bureaucrats are always greedy.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""The more bureaucrats run charities, the more people who need them.""

- This statement suggests a correlation between the number of bureaucrats running charities and the number of people who need the services of those charities. It implies that an increase in bureaucratic involvement in charities leads to an increase in the number of people needing charity services.

### Hypothesis:
""Bureaucrats are always greedy.""

- This statement makes a general claim about the nature of bureaucrats, specifically that they are always greedy.

### Analysis:
1. **Relevance**: The Premise discusses the effect of bureaucrats running charities on the number of people needing charity services. The Hypothesis makes a general statement about the character of bureaucrats.
2. **Direct Connection**: There is no direct connection between the Premise and the Hypothesis. The Premise does not provide any information about the greediness of bureaucrats.
3. **Implication**: The Premise does not imply anything about the personal characteristics of bureaucrats, such as greediness. It only discusses the outcome of their involvement in charities.
4. **Contradiction**: The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis either. The statement about bureaucrats being greedy is unrelated to the correlation mentioned in the Premise.

### Conclusion:
Given that the Premise does not provide any information that would make the Hypothesis definitely true or false, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Therefore, the appropriate numerical value is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more bureaucrats run charities, the more people who need them.",Bureaucrats are always greedy.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""The more bureaucrats run charities, the more people who need them.""
   - This statement suggests a correlation between the number of bureaucrats running charities and an increase in the number of people who need those charities. It implies that bureaucratic management of charities might be inefficient or counterproductive.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""Bureaucrats are always greedy.""
   - This statement makes a general claim about the nature of bureaucrats, specifically that they are always greedy.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise discusses the effect of bureaucrats running charities on the number of people needing those charities, but it does not make any direct claim about the personal characteristics of bureaucrats, such as greed.
   - The Hypothesis makes a broad generalization about bureaucrats being greedy, which is not directly addressed or implied by the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide any information about the personal traits of bureaucrats, it neither supports nor contradicts the Hypothesis.
   - The Hypothesis could be true or false independently of the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

comparative-correlative,partial,"The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.",Senior management is always micromanaging our decisions.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.""
   - This means that senior management's involvement increases with the cost of the decision. It implies a correlation between the cost of a decision and the level of involvement from senior management.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Senior management is always micromanaging our decisions.""
   - This statement suggests that senior management is involved in all decisions, regardless of their cost. The term ""always micromanaging"" implies constant and detailed involvement in every decision.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that senior management's involvement is conditional and increases with the cost of the decision.
   - The Hypothesis states that senior management is involved in all decisions, without any condition related to the cost.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis contradicts the Premise because the Premise suggests a conditional involvement based on cost, whereas the Hypothesis suggests unconditional and constant involvement.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.",Senior management likes to oversee decisions that are most likely to cost a lot of money.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.""
- This statement suggests that as the cost of a decision increases, the involvement of senior management also increases.

Hypothesis: ""Senior management likes to oversee decisions that are most likely to cost a lot of money.""
- This statement suggests that senior management has a preference for overseeing decisions that are likely to be expensive.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

1. **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise must directly support the Hypothesis without any additional assumptions. The Premise states a correlation between decision cost and senior management involvement but does not explicitly state that senior management ""likes"" to oversee expensive decisions. It only states that they are more involved as costs increase.

2. **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information about the preferences or likes of senior management. It only indicates their involvement based on the cost of decisions. Therefore, the Hypothesis could be true, but it is not necessarily supported by the Premise alone.

3. **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to suggest that senior management does not oversee expensive decisions or prefers not to. However, the Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis; it simply does not provide enough information to confirm it.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.",Senior management doesn't care much about the cost of potential decisions.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.""
- This statement suggests a direct relationship between the cost of a decision and the involvement of senior management. Specifically, it implies that as the cost of a decision increases, senior management's involvement also increases.

Hypothesis: ""Senior management doesn't care much about the cost of potential decisions.""
- This statement suggests that senior management is indifferent to the cost of decisions, implying that their involvement is not influenced by the cost.

Now, let's compare the two statements:
1. The Premise indicates a positive correlation between decision cost and senior management involvement.
2. The Hypothesis indicates that senior management is indifferent to decision cost, suggesting no correlation between cost and involvement.

These two statements are in direct opposition to each other. The Premise states that senior management's involvement increases with cost, while the Hypothesis states that senior management does not care about the cost.

Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

The correct relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.""
   - This statement suggests that there is a task or activity that needs to be completed quickly in order to proceed with the game.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The game will be fun.""
   - This statement asserts that the game will be enjoyable.

3. **Relation Analysis**:
   - The Premise talks about the speed of completing a task to proceed with the game but does not provide any information about the nature or enjoyment of the game itself.
   - The Hypothesis makes a claim about the enjoyment of the game, which is not addressed or implied by the Premise.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide any information that would confirm or deny the enjoyment of the game, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.",We have to do this before the game can start.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.""
   - This implies that there is a task (""this"") that needs to be completed, and the speed at which it is done affects how quickly they can proceed with the game.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""We have to do this before the game can start.""
   - This suggests that the task (""this"") is a prerequisite for the game to begin.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that completing the task quickly will allow them to proceed with the game more quickly, but it does not explicitly state that the game cannot start until the task is done.
   - The Hypothesis states that the task must be completed before the game can start, which is a stronger assertion than what is given in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly confirm that the game cannot start until the task is done; it only suggests that the game can proceed faster if the task is done quickly.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to definitively support or contradict the Hypothesis.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral

Thus, the final output is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.",We don't have to do this before the game starts.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.""
   - This implies that there is a task that needs to be completed before the game can proceed. The speed at which this task is completed affects how soon the game can start.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""We don't have to do this before the game starts.""
   - This suggests that the task mentioned in the Premise is not a prerequisite for starting the game.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise implies that the task must be done before the game can proceed (""the faster we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game"").
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that the task does not need to be done before the game starts.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the implication of the Premise, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value for the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.",More snow makes skiers go faster down the slopes.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.""
   - This statement suggests that an increase in snow leads to a decrease in danger for skiers. It implies a positive relationship between the amount of snow and skier safety.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""More snow makes skiers go faster down the slopes.""
   - This statement suggests that an increase in snow leads to skiers going faster.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about the relationship between snow and safety, indicating that more snow reduces danger.
   - The Hypothesis talks about the relationship between snow and speed, indicating that more snow increases speed.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis address different aspects of skiing conditions (safety vs. speed).
   - The Premise does not provide information about the speed of skiers, only about their safety.
   - The Hypothesis does not provide information about the safety of skiers, only about their speed.

Given that the Premise and the Hypothesis discuss different outcomes (safety vs. speed) and there is no direct logical connection or contradiction between them, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.",It's most safe to ski if there has been a substantial snowfall recently.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.""
   - This statement suggests that an increase in snowfall correlates with a decrease in danger for skiers.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""It's most safe to ski if there has been a substantial snowfall recently.""
   - This statement suggests that substantial snowfall makes skiing the safest.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that more snow leads to less danger, implying that substantial snowfall is safer for skiers.
   - The Hypothesis states that substantial snowfall makes skiing the safest, which aligns with the idea that more snow reduces danger.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise. If more snow leads to less danger, then substantial snowfall would indeed make skiing safer.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.",It is too dangerous to ski on days when there was heavy snow recently.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.""
Hypothesis: ""It is too dangerous to ski on days when there was heavy snow recently.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The premise states that an increase in snow leads to a decrease in danger for skiers. This implies that more snow makes skiing safer.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The hypothesis claims that it is too dangerous to ski on days when there has been heavy snow recently. This implies that more snow makes skiing more dangerous.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The premise suggests a positive relationship between snow and safety (more snow = less danger).
   - The hypothesis suggests a negative relationship between snow and safety (more snow = more danger).

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. The premise says more snow reduces danger, while the hypothesis says more snow increases danger.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more they work, the more I will pay them.",My workers always work very hard.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The more they work, the more I will pay them.""
- This statement indicates a conditional relationship between the amount of work done and the amount of payment. It suggests that payment is directly proportional to the amount of work.

Hypothesis: ""My workers always work very hard.""
- This statement asserts that the workers consistently put in a lot of effort.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

1. **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise would need to imply that the workers always work very hard. However, the Premise only states a conditional relationship about payment based on work done, not the actual work habits of the workers.

2. **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide any information about the actual work habits of the workers; it only describes a payment condition. Therefore, the Hypothesis could be true (if the workers do work hard) or false (if they do not work hard), but the Premise does not give enough information to determine this.

3. **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to imply that the workers do not work hard. However, the Premise does not make any claims about the workers' actual work habits, so there is no direct contradiction.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral

The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to definitively determine the truth of the Hypothesis. 

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more they work, the more I will pay them.",I intend to compensate my workers based on their amount of work.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more they work, the more I will pay them.""
   - This statement indicates a direct correlation between the amount of work done and the payment received. It implies that payment is proportional to the amount of work.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I intend to compensate my workers based on their amount of work.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker plans to pay workers according to the amount of work they do. It aligns with the idea of proportional compensation.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states a specific relationship: increased work leads to increased pay.
   - The Hypothesis states a general intention to compensate based on work done.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is a general statement that aligns with the specific relationship described in the Premise.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because it directly follows from the idea that more work results in more pay.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

Final Answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more they work, the more I will pay them.",I never pay my workers.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more they work, the more I will pay them.""
   - This statement implies a direct correlation between the amount of work done by the workers and the payment they receive. It suggests that payment is contingent on the amount of work performed.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I never pay my workers.""
   - This statement asserts that the speaker does not pay their workers at all, regardless of the amount of work done.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that payment is given based on the amount of work done.
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that no payment is given to the workers.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis states that no payment is given, it directly contradicts the Premise, which states that payment is given based on work.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
