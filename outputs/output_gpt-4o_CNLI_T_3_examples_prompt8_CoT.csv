let-alone,substantive,"A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.",There will be peaceful negotiation of a ceasefire.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.""
   - This means that achieving a ceasefire will require long negotiations, and achieving lasting peace will require even more effort.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""There will be peaceful negotiation of a ceasefire.""
   - This suggests that the negotiations for a ceasefire will be conducted in a peaceful manner.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise emphasizes the difficulty and length of the negotiations required for a ceasefire and lasting peace.
   - The Hypothesis focuses on the nature of the negotiations for a ceasefire, specifically that they will be peaceful.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not provide information about the nature (peaceful or otherwise) of the negotiations, only that they will be long.
   - The Hypothesis introduces an additional detail (peaceful negotiations) that is not addressed in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. The Premise does not confirm or deny the peaceful nature of the negotiations.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.",Negotiating lasting peace will take less time than negotiating a ceasefire.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.""
   - This means that achieving a ceasefire will require long negotiations, and achieving lasting peace will require even longer negotiations.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Negotiating lasting peace will take less time than negotiating a ceasefire.""
   - This suggests that the time required to negotiate lasting peace is shorter than the time required to negotiate a ceasefire.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates that lasting peace will take longer to negotiate than a ceasefire.
   - The hypothesis contradicts this by stating that lasting peace will take less time to negotiate than a ceasefire.

4. **Inference**:
   - Since the hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the premise, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.","It will take long negotiation to achieve a ceasefire, and even longer negotiation to achieve lasting peace.",0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.""
   - This means that achieving a ceasefire will require long negotiation, and achieving lasting peace will require even more negotiation.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""It will take long negotiation to achieve a ceasefire, and even longer negotiation to achieve lasting peace.""
   - This means that achieving a ceasefire will require long negotiation, and achieving lasting peace will require even more negotiation.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same idea: achieving a ceasefire will take long negotiation, and achieving lasting peace will take even longer negotiation.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because they both express the same information.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.,Both individuals and society will be consistent after difficulty.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.""
   - This means that it is already challenging for an individual to maintain consistency, and it implies that it is even more challenging for a society to do so.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Both individuals and society will be consistent after difficulty.""
   - This suggests that despite the difficulty, both individuals and society will achieve consistency.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise emphasizes the difficulty of achieving consistency for both individuals and society, suggesting that it is unlikely or very challenging.
   - The hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that both individuals and society will achieve consistency after facing difficulty, which is a more optimistic outcome than what the premise implies.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis contradicts the premise because the premise implies that achieving consistency is very difficult and perhaps unlikely, especially for a society, while the hypothesis states that consistency will be achieved despite the difficulty.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.,It is easier for a society to be consistent than an individual.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.""
   - This means that being consistent is already challenging for an individual, and it implies that it is even more challenging for a society to be consistent.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""It is easier for a society to be consistent than an individual.""
   - This suggests that the hypothesis is claiming the opposite of what the premise implies. It states that a society finds it easier to be consistent compared to an individual.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise implies that consistency is more difficult for a society than for an individual.
   - The hypothesis claims that consistency is easier for a society than for an individual.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. The premise suggests that societal consistency is more difficult, while the hypothesis suggests it is easier.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.,It is easier for an individual to be consistent than a society.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.""
   - This statement suggests that it is already challenging for an individual to maintain consistency, and it implies that it is even more challenging for a society to do so.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""It is easier for an individual to be consistent than a society.""
   - This statement directly states that it is easier for an individual to maintain consistency compared to a society.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise implies that maintaining consistency is difficult for both individuals and societies, with an emphasis that it is even more difficult for a society.
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states that it is easier for an individual to be consistent than for a society.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis aligns with the implication of the Premise. The Premise suggests a greater difficulty for societies compared to individuals, which is consistent with the Hypothesis stating that it is easier for individuals.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

let-alone,substantive,"I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.","I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl living in Ohio.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.""

### Hypothesis:
""I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl living in Ohio.""

### Analysis:
1. **Commonality**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis share the initial part: ""I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl..."".
2. **Difference**: The difference lies in the specific description of the girl:
   - Premise: ""a girl of your tender years and experience.""
   - Hypothesis: ""a girl living in Ohio.""

### Inference:
- The Premise expresses distress at the idea of any ladies reading it, and even more so at a girl of tender years and experience reading it.
- The Hypothesis expresses distress at the idea of any ladies reading it, and even more so at a girl living in Ohio reading it.

### Conclusion:
- The Premise does not specify the location of the girl, but it emphasizes her tender years and experience.
- The Hypothesis changes the specific characteristic of the girl from ""tender years and experience"" to ""living in Ohio.""
- The change in the specific characteristic of the girl does not directly contradict the Premise, nor does it confirm it. It introduces a new, unrelated characteristic (living in Ohio) that is not addressed in the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis introduces a new characteristic that is not addressed in the Premise, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

### Final Answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.","I would like to hear of ladies reading anything they like, no matter the age of them.",2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.""

- The speaker expresses distress at the idea of any ladies reading ""it.""
- The speaker is even more distressed at the idea of a young, inexperienced girl reading ""it.""

### Hypothesis:
""I would like to hear of ladies reading anything they like, no matter the age of them.""

- The speaker expresses a positive sentiment towards ladies reading anything they like.
- The speaker does not make any distinction based on age or experience.

### Analysis:
1. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Premise: Negative sentiment towards ladies (especially young girls) reading ""it.""
   - Hypothesis: Positive sentiment towards ladies reading anything they like.

2. **Content Analysis**:
   - Premise: Specific concern about the content being read by ladies, especially young girls.
   - Hypothesis: General approval of ladies reading anything, without concern for content or age.

3. **Contradiction Check**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis express directly opposing views on the matter of ladies reading.
   - The Premise is concerned and distressed, while the Hypothesis is approving and encouraging.

Given these points, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because they express contradictory sentiments and views.

### Conclusion:
The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

**Relation Output: 2**",**Relation Output: 2**,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.",I would be distressed to hear of a girl of your tender years and experience reading it.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading ""it"".
   - The speaker would be even more distressed to hear of a girl of tender years and experience reading ""it"".

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The speaker would be distressed to hear of a girl of tender years and experience reading ""it"".

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis is a specific case of the Premise. The Premise states a general distress about any ladies reading ""it"" and emphasizes that this distress would be even greater for a girl of tender years and experience.
   - The Hypothesis directly states the specific case of distress about a girl of tender years and experience reading ""it"".

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise and is a specific instance of what the Premise describes, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,"None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.",The arguments are not presented in a convincing order.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.""
   - This means that the arguments are not strong and definitely not conclusive.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""The arguments are not presented in a convincing order.""
   - This suggests that the arguments might not be convincing due to their order of presentation.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise focuses on the inherent strength and conclusiveness of the arguments.
   - The hypothesis focuses on the order of presentation affecting their convincing nature.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise, as it is possible that arguments that are not strong or conclusive could also be poorly ordered.
   - However, the hypothesis introduces a new aspect (order of presentation) that is not addressed in the premise.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.",All of the given arguments are strong and conclusive.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.""
   - This means that the arguments are not strong, and they are even less likely to be conclusive.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""All of the given arguments are strong and conclusive.""
   - This directly contradicts the premise, which states that none of the arguments are strong or conclusive.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis asserts the exact opposite of what the premise states.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

The numerical value corresponding to Contradiction is **2**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.",None of these arguments is conclusive.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.""
Hypothesis: ""None of these arguments is conclusive.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The phrase ""None of these arguments is notably strong"" indicates that the arguments are weak.
   - The phrase ""let alone conclusive"" suggests that if the arguments are not even notably strong, they are certainly not conclusive. This implies that being conclusive is a higher standard that the arguments do not meet.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis states directly that ""None of these arguments is conclusive.""

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise implies that the arguments are not conclusive because they are not even notably strong.
   - The Hypothesis directly states that the arguments are not conclusive.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true. The Premise provides a stronger statement that includes the Hypothesis as a part of it.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

let-alone,substantive,"Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.",Ambiguous promises given are not to be happily accepted.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.""
   - This means that vague promises are not sufficient for satisfaction, and even less so for complacency.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Ambiguous promises given are not to be happily accepted.""
   - This means that ambiguous (or vague) promises should not be accepted with happiness or satisfaction.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that vague promises are not grounds for satisfaction or complacency.
   - The Hypothesis states that ambiguous promises should not be happily accepted.
   - Both statements convey a similar sentiment: vague or ambiguous promises are not sufficient for a positive emotional response (satisfaction or happiness).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise, focusing on the idea that vague promises should not be accepted with satisfaction.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,"Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.",The speaker is more complacent than satisfied when hearing vague promises.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.""
   - This means that vague promises do not provide a basis for satisfaction, and even less so for complacency. In other words, if vague promises are not enough for satisfaction, they are certainly not enough for complacency.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""The speaker is more complacent than satisfied when hearing vague promises.""
   - This suggests that the speaker feels more complacent than satisfied when hearing vague promises.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates that vague promises are insufficient for both satisfaction and complacency, with complacency being even less likely than satisfaction.
   - The hypothesis, however, suggests the opposite: that the speaker feels more complacent than satisfied when hearing vague promises.

4. **Inference**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. The premise states that vague promises are not enough for satisfaction and even less so for complacency, while the hypothesis claims that the speaker is more complacent than satisfied.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

**Final Answer**:
2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.",The promises given are vague and the speaker will not be satisfied nor complacent.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.""
   - This means that the promises are vague and do not provide a basis for satisfaction. Furthermore, they certainly do not provide a basis for complacency, which is an even stronger state of contentment than satisfaction.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""The promises given are vague and the speaker will not be satisfied nor complacent.""
   - This means that the promises are vague, and as a result, the speaker will neither be satisfied nor complacent.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates that vague promises are insufficient for satisfaction and even more so for complacency.
   - The hypothesis aligns with this by stating that the speaker will not be satisfied nor complacent due to the vagueness of the promises.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis is directly supported by the premise. The premise provides a stronger statement that encompasses the hypothesis.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

let-alone,substantive,"Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.",Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to adequately tax the aging population who would be retiring in the near future.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.""

### Hypothesis:
""Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to adequately tax the aging population who would be retiring in the near future.""

### Analysis:
1. **Content Comparison**:
   - The Premise discusses the Government's failure to address current failures and future challenges in a general sense.
   - The Hypothesis specifies a particular issue (taxing the aging population) as an example of the Government's failure.

2. **Specificity**:
   - The Hypothesis is more specific than the Premise. It provides a concrete example of a failure (taxing the aging population) that could be considered part of the broader failures mentioned in the Premise.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise. It could be seen as an instance of the broader failures mentioned in the Premise.
   - However, the Premise does not explicitly mention anything about taxing the aging population, so the Hypothesis introduces new information that is not directly entailed by the Premise.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the specific claim made in the Hypothesis.

### Relation:
1",1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.",The Government always owns up to failures committed by them throughout the years and everyone else agrees.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.""
   - This implies that according to Mr. Brown, the Government is not addressing current failures and is even less likely to address future challenges.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that ""The Government always owns up to failures committed by them throughout the years and everyone else agrees.""
   - This implies that the Government consistently acknowledges its failures and there is a consensus on this acknowledgment.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise suggests that the Government is failing to address current and future issues.
   - The Hypothesis suggests the opposite, that the Government always acknowledges its failures and there is agreement on this.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise indicates a failure to address issues, while the Hypothesis indicates consistent acknowledgment and agreement on addressing failures.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.",Mr. Brown stated that the Government is not prepared to face the challenges of the future.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.""
   - This means that according to Mr. Brown, the Government is not handling current issues well and is even less prepared to handle future challenges.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Mr. Brown stated that the Government is not prepared to face the challenges of the future.""
   - This means that according to Mr. Brown, the Government is not ready to deal with future challenges.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the Government has failed to face current failures and is even less prepared for future challenges.
   - The Hypothesis states that the Government is not prepared for future challenges.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is a subset of the information provided in the Premise. The Premise provides a stronger statement by including both present failures and future challenges, while the Hypothesis focuses only on the future challenges.
   - Given that the Premise includes the information in the Hypothesis and more, the Hypothesis is definitely true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:

let-alone,substantive,There must have been text books around at one time but I can not even identify any titles let alone suppliers.,The speaker does not often read text books if they cannot identify any.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker mentions that there must have been textbooks around at one time.
   - The speaker cannot identify any titles of these textbooks.
   - The speaker also cannot identify any suppliers of these textbooks.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis suggests that the speaker does not often read textbooks if they cannot identify any.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates a lack of ability to identify titles and suppliers of textbooks, but it does not directly address the frequency of reading textbooks.
   - The hypothesis makes an inference about the speaker's reading habits based on their inability to identify textbooks.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis is making an assumption about the speaker's reading habits based on the information given in the premise.
   - The premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the speaker's reading habits.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

   - The speaker states that they cannot even identify any titles, let alone suppliers.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis claims that the speaker knows a lot about textbooks, including their titles and where they might come from.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates a lack of knowledge about textbooks, specifically mentioning an inability to identify titles or suppliers.
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that the speaker knows a lot about textbooks, including their titles and suppliers.

4. **Inference**:
   - Given the premise, the hypothesis cannot be true because it directly contradicts the information provided in the premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:

### Premise:
""There must have been text books around at one time but I can not even identify any titles let alone suppliers.""

### Hypothesis:
""The speaker can deduce textbooks exist, but cannot identify any titles or their suppliers.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Existence of Textbooks:**
   - **Premise:** ""There must have been text books around at one time"" suggests that the speaker believes textbooks existed at some point.
   - **Hypothesis:** ""The speaker can deduce textbooks exist"" aligns with the premise's suggestion that textbooks existed.

2. **Identification of Titles:**
   - **Premise:** ""I can not even identify any titles"" indicates the speaker cannot identify any textbook titles.
   - **Hypothesis:** ""but cannot identify any titles"" directly matches the premise's statement about the inability to identify titles.

3. **Identification of Suppliers:**
   - **Premise:** ""let alone suppliers"" implies that if the speaker cannot identify titles, they certainly cannot identify suppliers.
   - **Hypothesis:** ""or their suppliers"" matches the premise's implication that the speaker cannot identify suppliers.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis accurately reflects the information given in the Premise. The speaker's belief in the existence of textbooks, and their inability to identify titles or suppliers, is consistent between the Premise and Hypothesis.

### Relation:
The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

let-alone,substantive,"Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.",I have friends who have been to other countries outside Australia.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.""

### Hypothesis:
""I have friends who have been to other countries outside Australia.""

### Analysis:
1. **Premise Breakdown**:
   - ""Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia"": This means the majority of the speaker's friends have not traveled outside Australia.
   - ""let alone been all over the world"": This emphasizes that not only have most friends not been outside Australia, but even fewer (if any) have traveled extensively around the world.

2. **Hypothesis Breakdown**:
   - ""I have friends who have been to other countries outside Australia"": This suggests that at least some of the speaker's friends have traveled to countries other than Australia.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that ""most"" friends haven't been outside Australia, which implies that a minority might have been outside Australia.
   - The Hypothesis claims that there are friends who have been to other countries outside Australia, which is consistent with the possibility that a minority of friends have traveled outside Australia.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise because the Premise allows for the possibility that some friends have been outside Australia, even though most have not. Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Premise: Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.

Hypothesis: I only have friends who have been to countries outside Australia.

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The premise states that the majority of the speaker's friends have not traveled outside Australia.
   - The phrase ""let alone been all over the world"" emphasizes that not only have most friends not been outside Australia, but they certainly haven't traveled extensively around the world.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis claims that the speaker's friends have all traveled to countries outside Australia.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The premise indicates that most friends have not been outside Australia.
   - The hypothesis asserts that all friends have been to countries outside Australia.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. If most friends haven't been outside Australia, it is impossible for all friends to have been to countries outside Australia.

way-manner,partial,"As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.",She was moving forward when a knight on horseback almost ran her over.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.""

### Hypothesis:
""She was moving forward when a knight on horseback almost ran her over.""

### Analysis:
1. **Movement Forward**:
   - Premise: ""As she felt her way forward"" indicates she was moving forward.
   - Hypothesis: ""She was moving forward"" directly aligns with this part of the premise.

2. **Knight on Horseback**:
   - Premise: ""suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her"" indicates the presence of a knight on horseback moving quickly past her.
   - Hypothesis: ""a knight on horseback almost ran her over"" suggests the knight on horseback came very close to her, which can be inferred from the knight galloping past her suddenly.

3. **Implication of Danger**:
   - Premise: The phrase ""galloped past her"" implies a sudden and potentially dangerous situation.
   - Hypothesis: ""almost ran her over"" explicitly states the danger, which is a reasonable interpretation of the knight galloping past her suddenly.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis is a reasonable interpretation of the Premise. It does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise, nor does it add any information that is not implied by the Premise. Therefore, the Hypothesis can be considered definitely true given the Premise.

### Relation:

way-manner,partial,"As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.","As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback stopped to help her along.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.""
   - Key points: 
     - She is moving forward.
     - A knight on horseback gallops past her.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback stopped to help her along.""
   - Key points:
     - She is moving forward.
     - A knight on horseback stops to help her.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis agree that she is moving forward.
   - The Premise states that the knight galloped past her, implying he did not stop.
   - The Hypothesis states that the knight stopped to help her, which directly contradicts the action described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The action of the knight in the Hypothesis (stopping to help) cannot be true if the action in the Premise (galloping past) is true.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis contradicts the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the correct relation is:

way-manner,partial,"As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.","As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback went past her.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.""
   - Key points: 
     - A woman is moving forward.
     - A knight on horseback gallops past her.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback went past her.""
   - Key points:
     - A woman is moving forward.
     - A knight on horseback goes past her.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis describe a woman moving forward.
   - Both mention a knight on horseback passing her.
   - The main difference is the wording: ""felt her way forward"" vs. ""was moving forward"" and ""galloped past her"" vs. ""went past her.""
   - ""Felt her way forward"" implies she might be moving cautiously or with difficulty, but it still means she is moving forward.
   - ""Galloped"" is a specific type of fast movement for a horse, while ""went"" is more general but does not contradict ""galloped.""

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a paraphrase of the Premise with slightly different wording but the same meaning.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

way-manner,partial,If you type in the following program exactly as listed and run it you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.,A snake-like pattern might appear on your screen when you run a specific program into your personal computer.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""If you type in the following program exactly as listed and run it you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.""

### Hypothesis:
""A snake-like pattern might appear on your screen when you run a specific program into your personal computer.""

### Analysis:
1. **Content Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that if you type in a specific program exactly as listed and run it, you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that a snake-like pattern might appear on your screen when you run a specific program on your personal computer.

2. **Certainty and Specificity**:
   - The Premise is quite specific and certain about the outcome: ""you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.""
   - The Hypothesis is less certain and more general: ""might appear"" and ""a specific program.""

3. **Key Points**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis talk about running a program and seeing a snake-like pattern on the screen.
   - The Premise is definite about the outcome, while the Hypothesis is not.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis is less certain than the Premise. The Premise guarantees the appearance of the pattern, while the Hypothesis only suggests a possibility. Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

### Relation:
1 – Neutral

The final output is:

way-manner,partial,If you type in the following program exactly as listed and run it you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.,"Nothing shows up on your computer when you run this specific program, much less something that resembles a snake.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that if you type in a specific program exactly as listed and run it, you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that nothing shows up on your computer when you run this specific program, much less something that resembles a snake.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise asserts that running the program will result in a fascinating pattern appearing on the screen.
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that nothing shows up on the screen when the program is run.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the outcome described in the Premise, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2

""There's a cool snake pattern that could appear on your screen when you follow the given program and run it exactly right.""

### Analysis:
1. **Content Comparison**:
   - **Premise**: Describes that typing and running a specific program will result in a fascinating pattern appearing on the screen.
   - **Hypothesis**: States that a cool snake pattern could appear on the screen if the given program is followed and run correctly.

2. **Key Elements**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis mention a pattern appearing on the screen as a result of running a program.
   - The Premise uses ""fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen,"" while the Hypothesis uses ""cool snake pattern.""
   - The Hypothesis uses ""could appear,"" which introduces a slight uncertainty compared to the Premise's definitive ""you will see.""

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is not definitively stating the same outcome as the Premise; it introduces a possibility (""could appear"") rather than a certainty (""you will see"").
   - This difference in certainty means the Hypothesis is not definitely true given the Premise but is also not contradictory.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, making the relationship **Neutral**.

way-manner,partial,"She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.","She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension at their suggestion that she go out without a coat.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.""

### Hypothesis:
""She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension at their suggestion that she go out without a coat.""

### Analysis:
1. **Subject and Action Consistency**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis describe the same subject (""She"") and a similar action (staring from one to the other and feeling apprehension).

2. **Emotional State**:
   - Both sentences describe the subject feeling apprehension.

3. **Additional Information**:
   - The Premise mentions ""apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine,"" which is a metaphorical description of her feeling.
   - The Hypothesis adds a specific reason for her apprehension: ""at their suggestion that she go out without a coat.""

### Determining the Relation:
- **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would need to be definitely true given the Premise. However, the Premise does not provide any information about a suggestion to go out without a coat.
- **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis introduces new information (the suggestion to go out without a coat) that is not present in the Premise. This new information could be true or false; the Premise does not confirm or deny it.
- **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would need to be definitely false given the Premise. There is no information in the Premise that directly contradicts the Hypothesis.

Since the Hypothesis introduces new information that is not addressed in the Premise, it falls under the category of Neutral.

### Conclusion:
The relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is Neutral.

### Final Output:

way-manner,partial,"She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.","Staring from one to the other, the girl felt only confidence and strength in her body.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.""
   - Key points: The subject (she) is staring from one to the other and is feeling apprehension, which is described as a cold shiver along her spine.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Staring from one to the other, the girl felt only confidence and strength in her body.""
   - Key points: The subject (the girl) is staring from one to the other and is feeling confidence and strength in her body.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the subject staring from one to the other.
   - The emotional states described are different: the Premise describes apprehension (a negative feeling), while the Hypothesis describes confidence and strength (positive feelings).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The emotional states are directly contradictory. The Premise states that the subject feels apprehension, while the Hypothesis states that the subject feels confidence and strength.
   - Given that these emotional states cannot coexist simultaneously in the same context, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:

way-manner,partial,"She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.",She felt apprehension course through her body as she stared from one to the other.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.""

### Hypothesis:
""She felt apprehension course through her body as she stared from one to the other.""

### Analysis:
1. **Subject and Action Consistency**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis describe the same subject (""She"") performing the same action (""stared from one to the other"").

2. **Emotion Description**:
   - The Premise describes ""feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.""
   - The Hypothesis describes ""felt apprehension course through her body.""

3. **Synonymy and Paraphrasing**:
   - ""Feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine"" and ""felt apprehension course through her body"" are essentially describing the same emotional experience using different words. ""Shiver its cold way along her spine"" is a more vivid description, but it conveys the same meaning as ""course through her body.""

4. **Temporal and Contextual Consistency**:
   - Both sentences occur in the same temporal context (while she is staring from one to the other).
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or adds uncertainty to the Premise.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis is a paraphrase of the Premise, maintaining the same meaning and context. Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis involve the same subjects (""We"") performing the same action (""picked out all of the best songs"" and ""sang our way across the rest of Europe"").

2. **Source of Songs**:
   - Premise: ""from the tapes""
   - Hypothesis: ""from our favorite German operas""
   - The source of the songs differs. The Premise mentions ""tapes,"" while the Hypothesis specifies ""German operas."" This difference introduces a new detail that is not present in the Premise.

3. **Geographical Consistency**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis mention ""sang our way across the rest of Europe,"" which is consistent.

### Conclusion:
- The Hypothesis introduces a specific detail about the source of the songs (German operas) that is not mentioned in the Premise. This additional detail does not contradict the Premise but rather adds information that is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.
- Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

### Hypothesis:
""Big, bosomy women love to eat a box of biscuits near them at work, even though coworkers can hear them crunching away the whole time.""

### Analysis:
1. **Specificity vs. Generalization**:
   - The Premise talks about a specific woman who needs a box of biscuits to work and is currently eating them, making noise that Sarella can hear.
   - The Hypothesis generalizes this behavior to all ""big, bosomy women,"" suggesting they love to eat biscuits at work and that coworkers can hear them.

2. **Content Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides specific details about one woman's behavior.
   - The Hypothesis makes a broad generalization about a group of women based on the behavior of one individual.

3. **Inference Type**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would need to be a definite truth derived from the Premise. However, the Premise does not provide enough information to generalize the behavior to all big, bosomy women.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise. The Premise describes one instance, but it does not confirm or deny the generalization made in the Hypothesis.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would need to be directly contradicted by the Premise. The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis; it simply does not provide enough evidence to support the generalization.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis generalizes the behavior described in the Premise, but the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny this generalization. Therefore, the relationship is **Neutral**.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""A middle-aged man could not get into the room.""
   - This statement indicates that a middle-aged man was unable to enter the room.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the man did enter the room.
   - The Hypothesis states that the man could not enter the room.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the man eased his way into the room, it is not possible that he could not get into the room.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.,A man of maybe fifty years moved carefully into the room.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

**Premise:** A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.
**Hypothesis:** A man of maybe fifty years moved carefully into the room.

1. **Subject Comparison:**
   - Premise: ""A middle-aged man""
   - Hypothesis: ""A man of maybe fifty years""
   - Analysis: The term ""middle-aged"" generally refers to someone around the age of 45-65. ""A man of maybe fifty years"" fits within this age range, so the subjects are consistent.

2. **Action Comparison:**
   - Premise: ""eased his way into the room""
   - Hypothesis: ""moved carefully into the room""
   - Analysis: The action ""eased his way"" implies moving carefully or gently, which is consistent with ""moved carefully.""

3. **Context and Additional Information:**
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis describe the same action of entering a room, with no additional conflicting information.

Given that the Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise in terms of both the subject and the action, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

**Conclusion:**
The relationship between the Premise and Hypothesis is one of Entailment.

way-manner,partial,I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.,I yawned three times on my journey to the Narrow Neck.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.""
2. **Hypothesis:** ""I yawned three times on my journey to the Narrow Neck.""

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

- **Premise Analysis:** The speaker mentions yawning their way back to the Narrow Neck. This implies that yawning occurred during the journey, but it does not specify the number of yawns.
- **Hypothesis Analysis:** The speaker specifies that they yawned three times during their journey to the Narrow Neck.

**Comparison:**
- The Premise indicates yawning during the journey but does not quantify it.
- The Hypothesis specifies a number (three yawns) during the journey.

**Inference Relation:**
- The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, as yawning three times is a possible scenario within the broader statement of yawning during the journey.
- However, the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the exact number of yawns.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

**Relation Output:** 1",**Relation Output:** 1,False,True,False,1

   - This suggests that the speaker was tired or sleepy as they made their way back to the Narrow Neck.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I was energized on my way back to Narrow Neck.""
   - This suggests that the speaker was full of energy or not tired as they made their way back to the Narrow Neck.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a state of tiredness or sleepiness.
   - The Hypothesis indicates a state of being energized, which is the opposite of being tired or sleepy.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the state described in the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.,I yawned at least once on my journey back to the Narrow Neck.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker yawned multiple times during their journey back to the Narrow Neck.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I yawned at least once on my journey back to the Narrow Neck.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker yawned at least one time during their journey back to the Narrow Neck.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker yawned multiple times (""yawned my way back""), which implies that they yawned at least once.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker yawned at least once.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the speaker yawned multiple times, it is definitely true that they yawned at least once.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.,I bought my flight ticket with ease onto the same flight as other passengers.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.""
   - This indicates that the speaker found it easy to purchase a ticket for a specific flight.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I bought my flight ticket with ease onto the same flight as other passengers.""
   - This suggests that the speaker easily bought a ticket for a flight that other passengers were also on.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the idea that the speaker found it easy to purchase a ticket for a specific flight.
   - The Hypothesis adds the detail that the flight had other passengers, which is a reasonable assumption and does not contradict the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because the ease of buying a ticket and the presence of other passengers on the flight are consistent and do not introduce any contradictory information.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.,It was a hard feat to buy my way onto the same flight.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

   - This statement indicates that the speaker found it simple to purchase a ticket for the same flight.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""It was a hard feat to buy my way onto the same flight.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker found it difficult to purchase a ticket for the same flight.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that it was easy to buy a ticket.
   - The Hypothesis states that it was hard to buy a ticket.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis are directly contradictory. If something is easy, it cannot simultaneously be hard.

Given this analysis, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.,It came easily for me to buy a ticket on the same flight.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.""
Hypothesis: ""It came easily for me to buy a ticket on the same flight.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The speaker states that it was easy to secure a spot on the same flight.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker states that it was easy to purchase a ticket for the same flight.

3. **Comparing the Statements:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the idea that it was easy to get on the same flight.
   - The phrase ""buy my way on to the same flight"" in the Premise is essentially equivalent to ""buy a ticket on the same flight"" in the Hypothesis.
   - Both statements imply ease in securing a spot on the flight.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because they both express the same idea using slightly different wording.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.,Constance was looking for first-class carriages to take a ride on.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.""
   - This sentence indicates that Constance is actively searching for first-class carriages on a platform.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Constance was looking for first-class carriages to take a ride on.""
   - This sentence suggests that Constance's purpose for looking for first-class carriages is to take a ride on them.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Constance is looking for first-class carriages.
   - The Hypothesis adds the reason for her search, which is to take a ride on them.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise. If Constance is looking for first-class carriages, it is reasonable to infer that she intends to take a ride on them.
   - There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the Hypothesis.
   - The Hypothesis is a plausible extension of the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

**Final Decision**:
0 – Entailment

Therefore, the relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.,Constance waited in line for the first-class carriages.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.""
   - This indicates that Constance is actively moving through the platform with the intention of finding the first-class carriages.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Constance waited in line for the first-class carriages.""
   - This suggests that Constance is stationary, waiting in a line specifically for the first-class carriages.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes Constance as moving and searching for the first-class carriages.
   - The Hypothesis describes Constance as waiting in line, which implies she has already found the location of the first-class carriages and is now waiting.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are different: moving and searching vs. waiting in line.
   - These actions cannot both be true simultaneously in the same context. If Constance is moving and searching, she cannot be waiting in line at the same time.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

**Relation Output**: 2",**Relation Output**: 2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.,Constance was looking for first-class carriages as she squeezed her way down to the platform.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.""
   - Key points: Constance is on the platform, squeezing her way down, and her goal is to find the first-class carriages.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Constance was looking for first-class carriages as she squeezed her way down to the platform.""
   - Key points: Constance is looking for first-class carriages and is squeezing her way down to the platform.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention Constance squeezing her way down and looking for first-class carriages.
   - The main difference is the direction or location mentioned: the Premise states she is already on the platform, while the Hypothesis suggests she is squeezing her way down to the platform.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis implies a slightly different scenario where Constance is moving towards the platform, whereas the Premise states she is already on the platform.
   - This difference introduces ambiguity about whether she is already on the platform or moving towards it, but it does not outright contradict the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise, as the exact location of Constance (whether she is already on the platform or moving towards it) is not definitively clear.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.,The practical man thought about the obstacles to his finding an affordable home.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.""

### Hypothesis:
""The practical man thought about the obstacles to his finding an affordable home.""

### Analysis:
1. **Content Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions that the practical man thought his way through ""these apparent obstacles,"" but it does not specify what these obstacles are.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that the obstacles are related to ""finding an affordable home.""

2. **Specificity**:
   - The Premise is general and does not provide details about the nature of the obstacles.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a specific context (finding an affordable home) that is not mentioned in the Premise.

3. **Inference Possibility**:
   - The Hypothesis could be true if the obstacles mentioned in the Premise are indeed related to finding an affordable home. However, the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny this specific context.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

### Conclusion:
Given that the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the specific context introduced in the Hypothesis, the relationship between the Premise and Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

### Final Output:
1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.,The careless man did not have to think about his easy going life.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.""
   - This sentence describes a practical man who is actively thinking and dealing with obstacles.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The careless man did not have to think about his easy going life.""
   - This sentence describes a careless man who does not think and has an easy-going life.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about a practical man who is thoughtful and dealing with obstacles.
   - The Hypothesis talks about a careless man who does not think and has an easy-going life.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis describe two different types of men with contrasting characteristics.
   - The practical man is thoughtful and dealing with obstacles, while the careless man is not thoughtful and has an easy-going life.
   - These descriptions are not compatible; they describe opposite behaviors and situations.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise because they describe fundamentally different and contradictory situations.

**Conclusion**: The relation is a contradiction.

**Output**: 2",**Output**: 2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.,The practical man had obstacles he could think his way through.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.""
   - This statement indicates that the practical man encountered obstacles and managed to think his way through them.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The practical man had obstacles he could think his way through.""
   - This statement suggests that the practical man had obstacles and implies that he was capable of thinking his way through them.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the practical man actually thought his way through the obstacles.
   - The Hypothesis states that the practical man had obstacles and implies the capability to think his way through them.

4. **Inference Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it is consistent with the idea that the practical man had obstacles and could think his way through them.
   - The Hypothesis is a generalization of the Premise. The Premise provides a specific instance of the practical man thinking his way through obstacles, while the Hypothesis states the general capability.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise and can be inferred from it, the relationship is one of entailment.

Therefore, the relation is:

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree on the sources of the grants.
   - The Hypothesis adds a specific detail about the size of the grants, describing them as ""record-breakingly enormous.""

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The additional detail in the Hypothesis about the size of the grants is not mentioned in the Premise. The Premise does not provide any information about the size of the grants, only that they were provided by the mentioned sources.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis introduces new information that is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. This makes the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis **Neutral**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""The Court's apparent detachment from politics is made possible by its nonelective status.""
   - This means that the Court is perceived to be detached from politics because its members are not elected.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that ""The Court's apparent detachment from politics is clear from the stately décor of the courtroom.""
   - This suggests that the detachment from politics is evident from the physical appearance or decoration of the courtroom.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise attributes the Court's detachment from politics to its nonelective status.
   - The Hypothesis attributes the Court's detachment from politics to the stately décor of the courtroom.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis provide different reasons for the Court's detachment from politics.
   - The Premise does not mention anything about the courtroom's décor, and the Hypothesis does not mention the nonelective status.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Justin Timberlake MAKES Alcoholism Fun In The New Rom-Com The Last Drop""
   - This statement indicates that Justin Timberlake is involved in a new romantic comedy (rom-com) called ""The Last Drop,"" which deals with the theme of alcoholism in a fun manner.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Justin Timberlake sings a hit song in a new rom-com called The Last Drop that deals with alcoholism.""
   - This statement suggests that Justin Timberlake sings a hit song in the same rom-com, ""The Last Drop,"" which deals with alcoholism.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not mention anything about Justin Timberlake singing a hit song. It only mentions his involvement in making alcoholism fun in the rom-com.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new element (singing a hit song) that is not present in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide any information about Justin Timberlake singing a hit song, we cannot definitively say that the Hypothesis is true or false based on the Premise alone.
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the singing aspect.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

**Premise:** Justin Timberlake MAKES Alcoholism Fun In The New Rom-Com The Last Drop

**Hypothesis:** Justin Timberlake does not make alcoholism look fun in the old rom-com The Last Drop.

1. **Identify Key Information in the Premise:**
   - Justin Timberlake
   - Makes alcoholism fun
   - New rom-com
   - The Last Drop

2. **Identify Key Information in the Hypothesis:**
   - Justin Timberlake

   - Old rom-com
   - The Last Drop

3. **Compare the Key Information:**
   - The Premise states that Justin Timberlake makes alcoholism fun.
   - The Hypothesis states that Justin Timberlake does not make alcoholism look fun.
   - The Premise mentions a ""new"" rom-com, while the Hypothesis mentions an ""old"" rom-com.

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise regarding whether Justin Timberlake makes alcoholism look fun.
   - The mention of ""new"" vs. ""old"" rom-coms introduces a potential ambiguity, but the primary contradiction is about making alcoholism look fun.

Given that the Hypothesis directly contradicts the main assertion of the Premise, the relationship is a contradiction.

**Premise:** ""Justin Timberlake MAKES Alcoholism Fun In The New Rom-Com The Last Drop""

**Hypothesis:** ""Justin Timberlake is in a new rom-com called The Last Drop where he makes alcoholism interesting.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Subject Identification:**
   - **Premise:** Justin Timberlake
   - **Hypothesis:** Justin Timberlake

2. **Action/Verb:**
   - **Premise:** MAKES Alcoholism Fun
   - **Hypothesis:** makes alcoholism interesting

3. **Context/Setting:**
   - **Premise:** In The New Rom-Com The Last Drop
   - **Hypothesis:** in a new rom-com called The Last Drop

### Comparison:

- **Subject Consistency:** Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention Justin Timberlake.
- **Action Consistency:** The Premise states that Justin Timberlake ""MAKES Alcoholism Fun,"" while the Hypothesis states he ""makes alcoholism interesting."" The terms ""fun"" and ""interesting"" are not identical but are closely related in this context, suggesting a similar meaning.
- **Context Consistency:** Both the Premise and the Hypothesis refer to a new rom-com called ""The Last Drop.""

### Conclusion:

The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise with slightly different wording but maintains the same essential meaning. The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise, nor does it leave out any critical information that would make it uncertain.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

resultative,schematic,This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.,This nice man has a mother who will kiss him to the point of unconsciousness.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.""
   - The premise suggests that the man desires for ""Mother"" to kiss him to the point where he becomes unconscious. The use of ""probably"" indicates some level of uncertainty about the man's desire.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""This nice man has a mother who will kiss him to the point of unconsciousness.""
   - The hypothesis states that the man has a mother who will actually kiss him until he becomes unconscious. This is a definitive statement about the action taking place.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates a desire or wish (""probably just wanted"") for the mother to kiss him unconscious, but it does not confirm that this action will actually happen.
   - The hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that the mother will indeed kiss him to the point of unconsciousness, which is a stronger and more certain claim than what is presented in the premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the premise only suggests a desire and does not confirm the action, the hypothesis cannot be definitively concluded from the premise.
   - The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the hypothesis.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.,This bad man has a mother that he never wants to lay a kiss on him.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.""
   - The premise suggests that a nice man desires a kiss from Mother that would render him unconscious. The tone is somewhat playful or exaggerated.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""This bad man has a mother that he never wants to lay a kiss on him.""
   - The hypothesis describes a bad man who has a mother, and he never wants her to kiss him.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise describes a ""nice man"" who wants a kiss from Mother.
   - The hypothesis describes a ""bad man"" who never wants a kiss from his mother.
   - The two statements describe different types of men (nice vs. bad) and their opposite desires regarding a kiss from their mother.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. The premise talks about a nice man wanting a kiss, while the hypothesis talks about a bad man not wanting a kiss.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.,"This nice man probably just wanted Mother to kiss him, causing him to be unconscious.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's break down the steps:

1. **Understand the Premise:**
   - Premise: ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.""
   - This suggests that the man desired a kiss from Mother that would result in him becoming unconscious.

2. **Understand the Hypothesis:**
   - Hypothesis: ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to kiss him, causing him to be unconscious.""
   - This suggests that the man desired a kiss from Mother that would result in him becoming unconscious.

3. **Compare the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis convey the same idea: the man wanted a kiss from Mother that would lead to him becoming unconscious.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise without changing its meaning.

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the same meaning, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.,I had brushed my hair until it felt soft.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.""
   - This indicates that the speaker brushed their hair to the point where it became very smooth.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I had brushed my hair until it felt soft.""
   - This suggests that the speaker brushed their hair until it felt soft to the touch.

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:
- **Smooth vs. Soft**: The terms ""smooth"" and ""soft"" are related but not identical. ""Smooth"" refers to the texture being even and without tangles, while ""soft"" refers to the tactile quality of being gentle to touch.
- **Implication**: Brushing hair until it is smooth often implies that it might also feel soft, but this is not necessarily always the case. Hair can be smooth but not soft, or soft but not smooth.

**Conclusion**:
- The Hypothesis (""I had brushed my hair until it felt soft"") may or may not be true given the Premise (""I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth""). The Premise does not definitively confirm or deny the Hypothesis.

Therefore, the relation is **Neutral**.

**Final Answer**:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.,I had brushed my nonexistent hair roughly.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.""
   - This indicates that the speaker has hair and that they brushed it in a manner that made it smooth.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I had brushed my nonexistent hair roughly.""
   - This suggests that the speaker is claiming to have no hair (nonexistent hair) and that they brushed it roughly.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker has hair and brushed it smoothly.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker has no hair and brushed it roughly.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the speaker has hair and brushed it smoothly, it cannot be true that the speaker has no hair and brushed it roughly.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the appropriate numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.,I had very smooth hair because I brushed it.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker took an action (brushing their hair) which resulted in their hair becoming very smooth.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I had very smooth hair because I brushed it.""
   - This statement suggests that the reason the speaker's hair is very smooth is due to the action of brushing it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states the action and the result: brushing the hair made it very smooth.
   - The Hypothesis provides a causal relationship: the hair is very smooth because it was brushed.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise. The action of brushing the hair leading to it being very smooth is explicitly stated in the Premise.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or goes beyond what is stated in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

resultative,schematic,You KILLED it stone-dead.,You killed someone.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""You KILLED it stone-dead.""
   - The phrase ""killed it stone-dead"" is an idiomatic expression. It typically means that something was done extremely well or effectively, not necessarily involving actual killing.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""You killed someone.""
   - This statement is literal and implies that a person was killed.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise uses an idiomatic expression that does not imply the literal killing of a person.
   - The Hypothesis interprets the action as a literal killing of a person.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not support the literal interpretation of killing a person, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,You KILLED it stone-dead.,You caused it to be more alive.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""You KILLED it stone-dead.""
   - The phrase ""killed it stone-dead"" means that something was completely and utterly killed, leaving no chance of it being alive.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""You caused it to be more alive.""
   - The phrase ""caused it to be more alive"" implies that the subject was made more alive, which is the opposite of being killed.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise states that something was killed completely, leaving it dead.
   - The Hypothesis states that the same thing was made more alive.
   - These two statements are directly contradictory because something that is killed stone-dead cannot be made more alive.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,You KILLED it stone-dead.,It was stone-dead as a result of you killing it.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""You KILLED it stone-dead.""
   - This statement indicates that the action of killing resulted in the subject being ""stone-dead,"" which means completely and utterly dead.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""It was stone-dead as a result of you killing it.""
   - This statement asserts that the subject was ""stone-dead"" because of the action of killing performed by ""you.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis directly follows from the Premise. The Premise states that the action of killing resulted in the subject being ""stone-dead,"" and the Hypothesis restates this outcome.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis that would make it uncertain or false given the Premise.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The tools were WIPED clean.,The tools were cleaned with a cloth.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The tools were WIPED clean.""
   - This statement indicates that the tools were cleaned by wiping them. It does not specify the exact method or material used for wiping, but it implies that some form of wiping action was involved in cleaning the tools.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""The tools were cleaned with a cloth.""
   - This statement specifies that the tools were cleaned using a cloth. It implies a specific method (using a cloth) for the cleaning process.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the tools were wiped clean, which generally means they were cleaned by some wiping action.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that the tools were cleaned with a cloth, which is a plausible method for wiping.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a specific instance of the general action described in the Premise. The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, and it is reasonable to infer that wiping could involve using a cloth.
   - However, the Premise does not explicitly state that a cloth was used, so the Hypothesis is not definitively true based on the Premise alone. It is a plausible scenario but not a guaranteed one.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as **Neutral**.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,The tools were WIPED clean.,The tools were extremely dirty.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The tools were WIPED clean.
Hypothesis: The tools were extremely dirty.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The statement ""The tools were WIPED clean"" indicates that the tools were cleaned, implying that any dirt or grime on them was removed.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The statement ""The tools were extremely dirty"" suggests that the tools were in a very dirty state.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise indicates that the tools are now clean.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that the tools are extremely dirty.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - If the tools are clean (as stated in the Premise), they cannot be extremely dirty at the same time.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the state of the tools as described in the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The tools were WIPED clean.,The tools were clean because they were wiped.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The tools were WIPED clean.""
   - This statement indicates that an action was performed (wiping) which resulted in the tools being clean.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The tools were clean because they were wiped.""
   - This statement suggests a causal relationship, stating that the reason the tools are clean is due to the action of wiping.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

- **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. If the tools were wiped clean, it logically follows that they are clean because they were wiped. The Hypothesis directly aligns with the information provided in the Premise.
- **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Premise did not provide enough information to confirm the Hypothesis.
- **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Premise directly contradicted the Hypothesis.

Given that the Premise states the tools were wiped clean, it directly supports the Hypothesis that the tools are clean because they were wiped. There is no additional information needed, and there is no contradiction.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The river FROZE solid.,The river was cold.,1,"Let's analyze the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The river FROZE solid.""
   - This indicates that the river's water turned into ice, which requires the temperature to be at or below the freezing point of water (0°C or 32°F).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""The river was cold.""
   - This suggests that the temperature of the river was low, but it does not specify how low. ""Cold"" is a relative term and can mean different temperatures to different people.

3. **Inference Relationship**:
   - If the river froze solid, it must have been at or below the freezing point, which is indeed very cold.
   - Therefore, if the river was frozen solid, it is definitely true that the river was cold.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Relation: 0",Relation: 0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The river FROZE solid.,The river had melted into liquid.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""The river FROZE solid.""
   - This means that the river turned from a liquid state to a solid state due to freezing.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""The river had melted into liquid.""
   - This means that the river turned from a solid state to a liquid state due to melting.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise states that the river is in a solid state because it froze.
   - The Hypothesis states that the river is in a liquid state because it melted.

4. **Inference:**
   - If the river is frozen solid, it cannot be in a liquid state at the same time.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

**Relation Output:** 2",**Relation Output:** 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The river FROZE solid.,The river is frozen solid.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise:** The river FROZE solid.
2. **Hypothesis:** The river is frozen solid.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

- The Premise states that the river ""froze solid,"" which indicates that at some point in time, the river underwent the process of freezing and became solid.
- The Hypothesis states that the river ""is frozen solid,"" which describes the current state of the river as being solidly frozen.

**Inference Relation:**

- The Hypothesis is describing the current state of the river as being frozen solid.
- The Premise indicates that the river has already undergone the process of freezing and is now solid.
- Given that the Premise confirms the river has frozen solid, it directly supports the Hypothesis that the river is currently frozen solid.

Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

**Conclusion:**

The relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

**Final Output:**
0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,It BROKE apart.,It broke into pieces by hand.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise: ""It BROKE apart.""**
   - This statement indicates that something has broken into separate parts. It does not specify how the breaking occurred, only that the object is now in pieces.

2. **Hypothesis: ""It broke into pieces by hand.""**
   - This statement adds a specific detail about the manner in which the breaking occurred, suggesting that the object was broken by hand.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis:

- **Entailment (0):** For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise must imply that the object was broken by hand. However, the Premise does not provide any information about how the breaking occurred, only that it did.

- **Neutral (1):** The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, but it also does not provide enough information to confirm it. The object could have been broken by hand, but it could also have been broken by some other means (e.g., by a tool, by accident, etc.).

- **Contradiction (2):** For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to imply that the object was not broken by hand. Since the Premise does not provide any information about the method of breaking, it does not contradict the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,It BROKE apart.,It was put together.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise: ""It BROKE apart.""**
   - This indicates that something was in a state of being broken or separated into pieces.

2. **Hypothesis: ""It was put together.""**
   - This suggests that something was in a state of being assembled or combined into a whole.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise states that the object is broken apart, which means it is not in a whole or assembled state.
   - The Hypothesis states that the object was put together, which means it is in a whole or assembled state.

4. **Inference:**
   - If something is broken apart, it cannot simultaneously be put together. These two states are mutually exclusive.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

The correct numerical value for this relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,It BROKE apart.,It was severed into more than one piece.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise: ""It BROKE apart.""**
   - This statement indicates that something has broken into pieces. The term ""broke apart"" suggests a separation into multiple parts.

2. **Hypothesis: ""It was severed into more than one piece.""**
   - This statement indicates that something was cut or divided into more than one piece. The term ""severed"" also implies a separation into multiple parts.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a situation where something is divided into multiple parts.
   - The Premise uses the term ""broke apart,"" which is consistent with the idea of being ""severed into more than one piece"" as described in the Hypothesis.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because ""broke apart"" inherently means that it was divided into more than one piece.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

resultative,schematic,He HAMMERED the metal flat.,He was making a sword by hammering metal.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He HAMMERED the metal flat.""
   - This statement indicates that someone used a hammer to flatten a piece of metal.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""He was making a sword by hammering metal.""
   - This statement suggests that the person was engaged in the process of making a sword, which involves hammering metal.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise only states that the person hammered the metal flat. It does not provide any information about the purpose or the final product of this action.
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information that the person was making a sword, which is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must definitively imply that the person was making a sword. However, the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm this.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The action of hammering metal flat could be part of making a sword, but it could also be for other purposes (e.g., making a sheet of metal, a different tool, etc.).
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must definitively rule out the possibility of making a sword. The Premise does not do this; it simply states an action without specifying the purpose.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is **Neutral (1)** because the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the specific purpose of making a sword.

**Final Answer**: 1",**Final Answer**: 1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,He HAMMERED the metal flat.,He enflated the metal into a balloon.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He HAMMERED the metal flat.""
   - This indicates that the person used a hammer to make the metal flat. The action of hammering implies a forceful and flattening process.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""He enflated the metal into a balloon.""
   - This suggests that the person somehow made the metal expand and take the shape of a balloon, which is the opposite of flattening.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The action described in the Premise (hammering the metal flat) is directly contradictory to the action described in the Hypothesis (inflating the metal into a balloon). Flattening and inflating are opposite processes.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis describes an action that cannot be true if the Premise is true, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value for the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,He HAMMERED the metal flat.,He flattened the metal by hammering.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He HAMMERED the metal flat.""
   - This statement indicates that the action of hammering was performed on the metal, resulting in it becoming flat.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""He flattened the metal by hammering.""
   - This statement suggests that the metal was made flat through the process of hammering.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis directly restates the result and method described in the Premise. Both statements convey the same information: the metal was hammered and as a result, it became flat.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a paraphrase of the Premise and conveys the same information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The dog BARKED the chickens awake.,The dog likes to wake the chickens up by barking.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The dog BARKED the chickens awake.""
   - This sentence indicates that the dog barked, and as a result, the chickens woke up.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""The dog likes to wake the chickens up by barking.""
   - This sentence suggests that the dog has a preference or habit of waking the chickens up by barking.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides a specific instance where the dog barked and the chickens woke up.
   - The Hypothesis generalizes this behavior, suggesting that the dog likes to do this regularly.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm that the dog likes to wake the chickens up by barking. It only states that the dog barked and the chickens woke up on this occasion.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not entail the Hypothesis, nor does it contradict it.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,The dog BARKED the chickens awake.,The dog was silent because there were chickens.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The dog BARKED the chickens awake.""
   - This means that the dog made a barking noise, which caused the chickens to wake up.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The dog was silent because there were chickens.""
   - This suggests that the dog did not make any noise (was silent) due to the presence of chickens.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the dog was barking.
   - The Hypothesis states that the dog was silent.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the dog was barking (Premise), it cannot be true that the dog was silent (Hypothesis).

Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

The relation is: 2",The relation is: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The dog BARKED the chickens awake.,The chickens woke to the dog's bark.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""The dog BARKED the chickens awake.""
   - This means that the dog's barking caused the chickens to wake up.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""The chickens woke to the dog's bark.""
   - This means that the chickens woke up because of the dog's barking.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis directly aligns with the information given in the Premise. Both statements indicate that the chickens woke up due to the dog's barking.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

resultative,schematic,Terry WIPED the table clean.,Terry had cleaned the table to eat.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""Terry WIPED the table clean.""
   - This indicates that Terry performed an action (wiping) that resulted in the table being clean.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""Terry had cleaned the table to eat.""
   - This suggests that Terry cleaned the table with the intention of eating.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise confirms that Terry cleaned the table.
   - The Hypothesis adds a purpose to the action (to eat), which is not explicitly stated in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise explicitly stated that Terry cleaned the table to eat.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide information about the reason for cleaning the table.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise stated a different reason for cleaning the table or if it stated that Terry did not clean the table to eat.

Since the Premise does not specify the reason for cleaning the table, the Hypothesis is possible but not certain. Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Terry WIPED the table clean.,Terry wiped the table with a greasy rag until it was black.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""Terry WIPED the table clean.""
   - This means that Terry performed an action (wiping) on the table, and as a result, the table became clean.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""Terry wiped the table with a greasy rag until it was black.""
   - This suggests that Terry used a greasy rag to wipe the table, and the table ended up being black (dirty) as a result.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the table became clean after Terry wiped it.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that the table became black (dirty) after Terry wiped it with a greasy rag.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The two statements are contradictory because the Premise states the table became clean, while the Hypothesis states the table became dirty (black).

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Terry WIPED the table clean.,The table was clean because Terry wiped it down.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""Terry WIPED the table clean.""
   - This indicates that Terry performed an action (wiping) that resulted in the table being clean.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""The table was clean because Terry wiped it down.""
   - This suggests that the table's cleanliness is a direct result of Terry's action of wiping it down.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis directly aligns with the Premise. The action described in the Premise (Terry wiping the table) leads to the result described in the Hypothesis (the table being clean).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""Terry PUSHED the door shut.""
   - This indicates that Terry used some force to close the door. The method of applying force is not specified beyond the fact that it was a push.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""Terry closed the door with his side.""
   - This suggests that Terry used his side (likely his body) to close the door. 

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Terry pushed the door shut, which is a general action.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that the push was done using his side.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is a specific instance of the general action described in the Premise. If Terry pushed the door shut, it is possible that he used his side to do so. The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, nor does it confirm it explicitly. 

Given that the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise, the relationship is Neutral.

resultative,schematic,Terry PUSHED the door shut.,Terry opened the door wide.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""Terry PUSHED the door shut.""
   - This indicates that Terry applied force to the door to close it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""Terry opened the door wide.""
   - This indicates that Terry moved the door in the opposite direction, making it fully open.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The action described in the Premise (closing the door) is directly opposite to the action described in the Hypothesis (opening the door wide).
   - If Terry pushed the door shut, it is not possible for the door to be wide open at the same time.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Terry PUSHED the door shut.,Terry shut the door by pushing it closed.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""Terry PUSHED the door shut.""
   - This statement indicates that Terry used a pushing action to close the door.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""Terry shut the door by pushing it closed.""
   - This statement suggests that Terry closed the door using a pushing action.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis directly restates the action described in the Premise, specifying that the door was shut by pushing it closed.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis compared to the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,He ATE himself sick.,He ate questionably fresh shellfish.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He ATE himself sick.""
   - This means that he ate so much or something so bad that it made him sick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""He ate questionably fresh shellfish.""
   - This suggests that he ate shellfish that might not have been fresh, which could potentially make someone sick.

3. **Relation Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis provides a specific scenario (eating questionably fresh shellfish) that could lead to the situation described in the Premise (eating himself sick).
   - However, the Premise does not specify what he ate or the condition of the food. It only states the result of his eating (getting sick).
   - The Hypothesis is one possible explanation for the Premise but is not definitively true based on the Premise alone. There could be other reasons for him getting sick from eating.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,He ATE himself sick.,He didn't eat.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""He ATE himself sick.""
   - This implies that he ate so much that it made him feel sick.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""He didn't eat.""
   - This implies that he did not consume any food.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise states that he ate to the point of feeling sick.
   - The Hypothesis states that he did not eat at all.

4. **Inference:**
   - If the Premise is true (he ate himself sick), then the Hypothesis (he didn't eat) cannot be true because the actions described are mutually exclusive. Eating to the point of sickness directly contradicts not eating at all.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

**Relation Output:** 2",**Relation Output:** 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,He ATE himself sick.,He felt sick from eating.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He ATE himself sick.""
   - This means that he ate so much that it caused him to feel sick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""He felt sick from eating.""
   - This means that his feeling of sickness was a result of eating.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis directly aligns with the Premise. The Premise states that he ate to the point of feeling sick, and the Hypothesis states that he felt sick from eating. There is a clear cause-and-effect relationship where the eating led to the sickness.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true. The Premise explicitly states that eating caused the sickness, which is exactly what the Hypothesis claims.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,She COUGHED herself sick.,She coughed too much from choking.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""She COUGHED herself sick.""
   - This implies that she coughed so much that it made her sick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""She coughed too much from choking.""
   - This suggests that the reason for her excessive coughing was choking.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates the result of excessive coughing (she became sick).
   - The Hypothesis provides a possible cause for the excessive coughing (choking).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not directly contradict the Premise. It is possible that she coughed too much from choking and as a result, became sick.
   - The Hypothesis does not necessarily follow directly from the Premise, as the Premise does not specify the cause of the coughing.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as Neutral.

The final output is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,She COUGHED herself sick.,Her coughing resulted in her feeling better.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""She COUGHED herself sick.""
   - This means that her coughing led to her becoming sick.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Her coughing resulted in her feeling better.""
   - This means that her coughing led to an improvement in her health.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the result of her coughing was that she became sick.
   - The Hypothesis states that the result of her coughing was that she felt better.

4. **Inference**:
   - The two statements are directly contradictory. The Premise indicates a negative outcome (becoming sick), while the Hypothesis indicates a positive outcome (feeling better).

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,She COUGHED herself sick.,She got sick from coughing.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""She COUGHED herself sick.""
   - This implies that the act of coughing led to her becoming sick. The phrase suggests a direct cause-and-effect relationship where coughing is the cause and becoming sick is the effect.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""She got sick from coughing.""
   - This hypothesis states that the reason for her sickness is coughing. It also implies a cause-and-effect relationship where coughing is the cause and becoming sick is the effect.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same cause-and-effect relationship: coughing leading to sickness.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or goes beyond what is stated in the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the information provided in the Premise, the relationship is one of **Entailment**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

resultative,schematic,The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.,The jackhammer pounding sometimes reaches 130 decibels.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.""
   - This means that the noise from the jackhammer was extremely loud, to the point that it caused deafness.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The jackhammer pounding sometimes reaches 130 decibels.""
   - This statement provides a specific measurement of the noise level produced by the jackhammer, indicating that it can reach 130 decibels.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes the effect of the jackhammer's noise (causing deafness), while the Hypothesis provides a factual statement about the noise level (130 decibels).
   - The Hypothesis does not directly confirm or deny the effect described in the Premise. It provides additional information that could be consistent with the Premise but does not necessarily entail it.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The fact that the jackhammer can reach 130 decibels does not definitively confirm that it caused deafness, nor does it contradict it. It is additional information that is neutral with respect to the effect described.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.,The jackhammer was easy on our ears.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.""
   - This means that the jackhammer was extremely loud, to the point that it caused deafness or a significant impact on hearing.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The jackhammer was easy on our ears.""
   - This means that the jackhammer was not loud and did not cause any discomfort to the ears.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the jackhammer was extremely loud and caused deafness.
   - The Hypothesis states that the jackhammer was not loud and was easy on the ears.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the jackhammer was extremely loud and caused deafness, it cannot be true that it was easy on the ears.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

The numerical value corresponding to Contradiction is **2**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.,We were deaf from the jackhammering.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.""
   - This sentence indicates that the action of the jackhammer pounding caused the subjects to become deaf.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""We were deaf from the jackhammering.""
   - This sentence states that the subjects became deaf as a result of the jackhammering.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an action (jackhammer pounding) and its direct consequence (causing deafness).
   - The Hypothesis describes the same consequence (deafness) and attributes it to the same cause (jackhammering).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a direct restatement of the consequence described in the Premise.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,Water FILLED the tub half full.,The half-full tub was dirty.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Water FILLED the tub half full.""
   - This means that the tub was filled with water to the halfway point.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The half-full tub was dirty.""
   - This statement asserts that the tub, which is half full, was dirty.

3. **Relation Analysis**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the tub was dirty. The Premise only states that the tub was filled halfway with water; it does not provide any information about the cleanliness of the tub.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide any information about the cleanliness of the tub, so it is possible that the tub was dirty, but it is also possible that it was clean.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that directly contradicts the Hypothesis. There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the idea that the tub was dirty.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Water FILLED the tub half full.,Water drained from the tub.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""Water FILLED the tub half full.""
   - This indicates that water was added to the tub until it reached the halfway mark.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""Water drained from the tub.""
   - This suggests that water was removed from the tub.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a situation where water is being added to the tub.
   - The Hypothesis describes a situation where water is being removed from the tub.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are opposite in nature. If water is being added to the tub (filling it), it cannot simultaneously be draining from the tub.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

The final output is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Water FILLED the tub half full.,The tub was half full of water.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Water FILLED the tub half full.""
   - This statement indicates that water was added to the tub until it reached the halfway mark.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The tub was half full of water.""
   - This statement asserts that the tub contained water up to the halfway mark.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis:

- The Premise states that water filled the tub to the halfway point.
- The Hypothesis states that the tub was half full of water.

Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because if water filled the tub to the halfway point, then it logically follows that the tub was half full of water.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

resultative,schematic,The sleeping pills MADE me sick.,I took sleeping pills before bed.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The sleeping pills MADE me sick.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker took sleeping pills and as a result, felt sick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I took sleeping pills before bed.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker took sleeping pills before going to bed.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that the speaker took sleeping pills and felt sick because of them.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker took sleeping pills before bed, but it does not mention the resulting sickness.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise because if the speaker took sleeping pills and felt sick, it is reasonable to infer that the speaker took the pills at some point, possibly before bed.
   - However, the Premise does not explicitly state the time when the pills were taken (before bed or otherwise), so the Hypothesis is not definitively true based on the Premise alone.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,The sleeping pills MADE me sick.,The sleeping pills make me feel good.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The sleeping pills MADE me sick.""
   - This indicates that the sleeping pills caused the speaker to feel unwell.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The sleeping pills make me feel good.""
   - This suggests that the sleeping pills have a positive effect on the speaker, making them feel good.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states a negative effect (sickness) caused by the sleeping pills.
   - The Hypothesis states a positive effect (feeling good) caused by the sleeping pills.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The two statements are directly contradictory. The Premise indicates a negative outcome, while the Hypothesis indicates a positive outcome from the same cause (sleeping pills).
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The sleeping pills MADE me sick.,I was sick from the sleeping pills I took.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The sleeping pills MADE me sick.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker took sleeping pills and as a result, they became sick.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I was sick from the sleeping pills I took.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker was sick and attributes the cause to the sleeping pills they took.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis directly aligns with the Premise. Both statements indicate that the speaker took sleeping pills and became sick as a result.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or adds uncertainty to the Premise.
   - The cause-and-effect relationship is clearly stated in both the Premise and the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,Harry SHOT Sam dead.,Harry hated Sam all of his life.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Harry SHOT Sam dead.""
   - This statement indicates that Harry shot Sam, resulting in Sam's death.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Harry hated Sam all of his life.""
   - This statement suggests that Harry had a lifelong hatred for Sam.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis:

- **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, it must be definitely true given the Premise. The Premise only states that Harry shot Sam dead; it does not provide any information about Harry's feelings towards Sam throughout his life. Therefore, the Hypothesis is not definitely true based on the Premise alone.

- **Neutral (1)**: For the Hypothesis to be neutral, it may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide any information about Harry's feelings towards Sam, so it is possible that Harry hated Sam all of his life, but it is also possible that he did not. The Premise does not confirm or deny the Hypothesis.

- **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, it must be impossible given the Premise. There is nothing in the Premise that contradicts the idea that Harry hated Sam all of his life. The Premise simply does not address Harry's feelings.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Harry SHOT Sam dead.,Harry saved Sam's life.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Harry SHOT Sam dead.""
   - This statement indicates that Harry shot Sam, resulting in Sam's death.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Harry saved Sam's life.""
   - This statement suggests that Harry performed an action that resulted in Sam's life being saved.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise clearly states that Sam is dead because Harry shot him.
   - The Hypothesis claims that Sam's life was saved by Harry.
   - These two statements are directly contradictory. If Sam is dead, he cannot have been saved by Harry.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Harry SHOT Sam dead.,Sam died from the shot Harry took.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Harry SHOT Sam dead.""
   - This statement indicates that Harry shot Sam, resulting in Sam's death.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Sam died from the shot Harry took.""
   - This statement suggests that Sam's death was a direct result of the shot fired by Harry.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

- **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. If Harry shot Sam dead, it logically follows that Sam died from the shot Harry took.
- **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Premise did not provide enough information to confirm the Hypothesis.
- **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Premise directly contradicted the Hypothesis.

Given the Premise, ""Harry SHOT Sam dead,"" it is clear that Sam's death was caused by the shot Harry took. Therefore, the Hypothesis, ""Sam died from the shot Harry took,"" is definitely true.

Thus, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,Sam TALKED himself hoarse.,Sam likes to talk.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""Sam TALKED himself hoarse.""
   - This means that Sam talked so much that he became hoarse, indicating a significant amount of talking.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""Sam likes to talk.""
   - This suggests that Sam has a preference or enjoyment for talking.

3. **Inference Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise must provide conclusive evidence that Sam likes to talk. While the Premise indicates that Sam talked a lot, it does not necessarily mean he likes to talk; he could have talked a lot for other reasons (e.g., necessity, obligation).
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise shows that Sam talked a lot, which could imply he likes to talk, but it is not definitive. There could be other reasons for his extensive talking.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to indicate that Sam does not like to talk. The Premise does not provide any information that contradicts the idea that Sam likes to talk.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relationship is **Neutral (1)** because the Premise suggests that Sam talked a lot, which might imply he likes to talk, but it is not conclusive.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Sam TALKED himself hoarse.,Sam's talking made his voice clearer.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""Sam TALKED himself hoarse.""
   - This means that Sam talked so much that his voice became hoarse, indicating a negative effect on his voice due to excessive talking.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""Sam's talking made his voice clearer.""
   - This suggests that Sam's talking had a positive effect on his voice, making it clearer.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a negative outcome (hoarse voice) from talking.
   - The Hypothesis indicates a positive outcome (clearer voice) from talking.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis present opposite outcomes from the same action (talking).
   - Since a hoarse voice and a clearer voice are contradictory outcomes, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Sam TALKED himself hoarse.,Sam's voice was hoarse from talking.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Sam TALKED himself hoarse.""
   - This means that Sam talked so much that his voice became hoarse.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Sam's voice was hoarse from talking.""
   - This means that the reason Sam's voice is hoarse is due to talking.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis directly aligns with the information provided in the Premise. The Premise states that Sam talked himself hoarse, which implies that his voice became hoarse as a result of talking.
   - There is no additional information or context needed to confirm the Hypothesis based on the Premise. The Hypothesis is a restatement of the consequence described in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.,His house was previously a darker color.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.""
   - This statement tells us that the house is now a bright shade of red due to the action of painting.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""His house was previously a darker color.""
   - This statement suggests that before the house was painted a bright shade of red, it was a darker color.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the previous color of the house. It only states the current color after painting.
   - The Hypothesis makes an assumption about the previous color of the house, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not give any information about the previous color of the house, we cannot definitively say that the Hypothesis is true or false based on the Premise alone.
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.,He scraped off the red paint from his house.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.""
   - This means that at some point, he applied red paint to his house.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""He scraped off the red paint from his house.""
   - This implies that he removed the red paint that was previously applied to his house.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise directly implies it. In this case, the Premise does not directly imply that he scraped off the paint; it only states that he painted the house red.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the Hypothesis. However, the act of painting and scraping off paint are somewhat contradictory actions.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. Since the Premise states that he painted the house red, and the Hypothesis states that he scraped off the red paint, these actions are contradictory. If he painted the house red, it cannot simultaneously be true that he scraped off the red paint (unless it happened at different times, but this is not specified).

Given the direct contradiction between painting the house red and scraping off the red paint, the most appropriate relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.,His house was bright red from paint.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.""
   - This statement indicates that the action of painting has been completed and the color used was a bright shade of red.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""His house was bright red from paint.""
   - This statement suggests that the house is currently bright red due to being painted.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

- The Premise states that the house was painted a bright shade of red.
- The Hypothesis states that the house is bright red as a result of being painted.

Given the Premise, it is logical to conclude that the house is indeed bright red from the paint. There is a direct connection between the action described in the Premise and the state described in the Hypothesis.

Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

The correct relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,She KICKED the door open.,She needed to get into the house quickly.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""She KICKED the door open.""
   - This indicates that she used force to open the door by kicking it.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""She needed to get into the house quickly.""
   - This suggests a reason or motivation for her action of kicking the door open.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

- **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the action of kicking the door open must directly imply that she needed to get into the house quickly. However, the Premise does not provide explicit information about her need or urgency; it only describes the action she took.

- **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The action of kicking the door open could be due to various reasons, such as urgency, frustration, or even an emergency. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the specific reason mentioned in the Hypothesis.

- **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to provide information that directly contradicts the need to get into the house quickly. There is no such contradictory information in the Premise.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,She KICKED the door open.,She slowly opened the door.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise: ""She KICKED the door open.""**
   - This indicates that the action of opening the door was done forcefully and suddenly by kicking it.

2. **Hypothesis: ""She slowly opened the door.""**
   - This suggests that the action of opening the door was done in a slow and gradual manner.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise describes a forceful and sudden action (kicking the door open).
   - The Hypothesis describes a slow and gradual action (slowly opening the door).

4. **Inference:**
   - The two actions described are mutually exclusive. If she kicked the door open, it cannot be true that she slowly opened the door. The nature of the actions contradicts each other.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

**Relation Output: 2**",**Relation Output: 2**,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,She KICKED the door open.,The door was open from her kick.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""She KICKED the door open.""
   - This statement indicates that the action of kicking resulted in the door becoming open.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""The door was open from her kick.""
   - This statement suggests that the door being open was a direct result of her kick.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

- **Entailment (0):** The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. If she kicked the door open, it logically follows that the door was open as a result of her kick.
- **Neutral (1):** The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Hypothesis introduced new information or possibilities not directly supported by the Premise.
- **Contradiction (2):** The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Hypothesis directly contradicts the information in the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis directly follows from the action described in the Premise, the relationship is one of entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,She tugged at the glass door.,She had a sliding glass door to her backyard.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""She tugged at the glass door.""
   - This statement indicates that she pulled or tried to open a glass door.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""She had a sliding glass door to her backyard.""
   - This statement suggests that she possesses a sliding glass door that leads to her backyard.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

- **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise must provide clear evidence that she has a sliding glass door to her backyard. The Premise only mentions that she tugged at a glass door, but it does not specify the type of door or its location.
  
- **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the type of door or its location. It is possible that the glass door she tugged at is a sliding door to her backyard, but it is also possible that it is a different type of door or located elsewhere.

- **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to provide information that directly contradicts the Hypothesis. The Premise does not provide any such contradictory information.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,She tugged at the glass door.,She made no motion towards the glass door.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: She tugged at the glass door.
Hypothesis: She made no motion towards the glass door.

1. **Premise Analysis**: The Premise states that ""She tugged at the glass door,"" which means she made a physical action towards the glass door by pulling it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: The Hypothesis states that ""She made no motion towards the glass door,"" which means she did not perform any action towards the glass door.

3. **Comparison**: The Premise indicates an action (tugging at the glass door), while the Hypothesis indicates the absence of any action towards the glass door. These two statements are directly contradictory because one states that an action occurred, and the other states that no action occurred.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,She tugged at the glass door.,She attempted to tug the glass door.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""She tugged at the glass door.""
   - This statement indicates that the action of tugging at the glass door has already occurred.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""She attempted to tug the glass door.""
   - This statement suggests that she made an effort to tug the glass door, but it does not confirm whether the action was completed.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

- **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the action described in the Hypothesis must be definitely true given the Premise. In this case, if she tugged at the glass door, it implies that she must have attempted to tug it. Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

- **Neutral (1)**: This would be the case if the Hypothesis could be true or false given the Premise. However, since the action of tugging inherently includes the attempt, this is not applicable here.

- **Contradiction (2)**: This would be the case if the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. Since the Premise confirms the action of tugging, it does not contradict the attempt to tug.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He tugged at the puppy's ears.,He had a puppy with long ears.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""He tugged at the puppy's ears.""
   - This statement indicates that there is a puppy and that someone (he) is tugging at its ears.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""He had a puppy with long ears.""
   - This statement suggests that the person (he) has a puppy and that the puppy has long ears.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

- **Entailment (0):** For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise must provide enough information to confirm the Hypothesis without any doubt. The Premise mentions that he tugged at the puppy's ears, but it does not specify the length of the ears. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the puppy has long ears based on the Premise alone.

- **Neutral (1):** The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide information about the length of the puppy's ears. It is possible that the puppy has long ears, but it is also possible that the puppy has short ears. There is no contradiction, but there is also no confirmation.

- **Contradiction (2):** For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise must provide information that directly contradicts the Hypothesis. The Premise does not provide any information about the length of the puppy's ears, so there is no contradiction.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relationship is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He tugged at the puppy's ears.,He pushed the puppy's ears.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He tugged at the puppy's ears.""
   - This indicates that the person pulled or gently pulled the puppy's ears.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""He pushed the puppy's ears.""
   - This indicates that the person applied force in a pushing manner to the puppy's ears.

3. **Comparison**:
   - ""Tugged"" and ""pushed"" are different actions. Tugging involves pulling, while pushing involves applying force in the opposite direction.
   - Since the actions described are different and cannot both be true simultaneously, the Hypothesis contradicts the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

**Relation Output**: 2",**Relation Output**: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He tugged at the puppy's ears.,The puppy's ears were tugged by him.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He tugged at the puppy's ears.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""The puppy's ears were tugged by him.""

- **Step 1: Check for Entailment (0)**
  - The Hypothesis is a passive rephrasing of the Premise. Both statements convey the same action performed by the same subject (he) on the same object (the puppy's ears).
  - Since the Hypothesis is a direct restatement of the Premise in passive voice, it is definitely true given the Premise.

- **Step 2: Check for Contradiction (2)**
  - There is no information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise. Both statements are consistent with each other.

- **Step 3: Check for Neutral (1)**
  - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that is uncertain or unrelated to the Premise. It is simply a rephrasing.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Relation: 0",Relation: 0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.",I tried to break my door down to leave my house.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.""
Hypothesis: ""I tried to break my door down to leave my house.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The speaker kicked at the door multiple times.
   - The door did not move or open as a result of the kicking.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker attempted to break down the door.
   - The purpose of breaking down the door was to leave the house.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The action described in the Hypothesis (""tried to break my door down"") is consistent with the action in the Premise (""kicked at the door a couple of times"").
   - The Premise does not explicitly state the reason for kicking the door, but it is plausible that the reason could be to leave the house.
   - The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis; it simply does not provide enough information to confirm the reason for the action.

4. **Determining the Relation:**
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise supports the possibility of the Hypothesis but does not confirm it definitively.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.",The door swung open immediately from one kick.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.""
   - This means that despite multiple attempts to kick the door, it remained closed and did not move.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The door swung open immediately from one kick.""
   - This suggests that the door opened right away with just a single kick.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the door did not move even after being kicked multiple times.
   - The Hypothesis states that the door opened immediately with one kick.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. According to the Premise, the door did not budge, whereas the Hypothesis claims it opened immediately with one kick.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the appropriate numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.",The door didn't budge from my multiple kicks at it.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker kicked the door multiple times, but the door did not move or open as a result.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The door didn't budge from my multiple kicks at it.""
   - This statement asserts that the door did not move as a result of the speaker's multiple kicks.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis directly restates the outcome described in the Premise: the door did not budge despite multiple kicks.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction between the two statements.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is one of **Entailment**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value for the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.,Henry Edison had gotten a flat on his old automobile.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.""
   - This statement describes an action where Henry Edison is kicking at the tire of an old automobile.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Henry Edison had gotten a flat on his old automobile.""
   - This statement suggests that Henry Edison experienced a flat tire on his old automobile.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state that the tire is flat; it only mentions that Henry Edison is kicking at the tire.
   - The Hypothesis infers a specific reason (a flat tire) for Henry Edison's action of kicking the tire.
   - There is no direct evidence in the Premise to confirm or deny that the tire is flat. The action of kicking the tire could be due to various reasons, not necessarily a flat tire.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise (there is no definitive evidence to confirm or deny the flat tire), the relationship is **Neutral**.

Therefore, the appropriate numerical value is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.,Hendy Edison shined his tire on his new automobile.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.""
   - This sentence describes an action performed by Henry Edison, specifically kicking a tire on an old automobile.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Hendy Edison shined his tire on his new automobile.""
   - This sentence describes a different action performed by someone named Hendy Edison, specifically shining a tire on a new automobile.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The names are slightly different: ""Henry Edison"" vs. ""Hendy Edison."" This could be a typo or a different person.
   - The actions are different: kicking a tire vs. shining a tire.
   - The objects are different: an old automobile vs. a new automobile.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are different and involve different objects (old vs. new automobile).
   - Given the differences in actions, objects, and potentially the person involved, the Hypothesis cannot be inferred from the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

**Relation Output**: 2",**Relation Output**: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.,Henry Edison tried to kick the tire on the old automobile.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.""
Hypothesis: ""Henry Edison tried to kick the tire on the old automobile.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile. This implies that he made an attempt to kick the tire, whether or not the kick was successful.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that Henry Edison tried to kick the tire on the old automobile. This suggests that he made an effort to kick the tire, but it does not necessarily confirm whether the kick was successful.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise indicates an action (kicking at the tire), which inherently includes the notion of trying to kick.
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states the attempt to kick the tire, which is a subset of the action described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it is consistent with the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a more general statement that is implied by the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis is definitely true if the Premise is true (since trying to kick is part of the action of kicking at the tire), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.,Luke tested the durability of the chair with his shoe.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.""
   - This sentence describes an action where Luke uses his leather half-boot to kick at the leg of a chair.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Luke tested the durability of the chair with his shoe.""
   - This sentence suggests that Luke's action was intended to test the durability of the chair using his shoe.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise describes a specific action (kicking the chair leg with a leather half-boot).
   - The Hypothesis interprets this action as a test of the chair's durability.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise explicitly stated that Luke was testing the durability of the chair.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm that Luke's intention was to test the durability of the chair. He could have been kicking the chair for other reasons.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise explicitly stated that Luke was not testing the durability of the chair.

Since the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the intention behind Luke's action, the relationship is best described as **Neutral**.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.,Luke pushed the chair away with his tennis shoe.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.""
   - This indicates that Luke used his leather half-boot to kick at the leg of a chair.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Luke pushed the chair away with his tennis shoe.""
   - This suggests that Luke used a tennis shoe to push the chair away.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are different: kicking vs. pushing.
   - The footwear mentioned is different: leather half-boot vs. tennis shoe.
   - The direction of the action is different: kicking at the leg vs. pushing the chair away.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise because the actions, footwear, and direction of the actions are all different.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis contradicts the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.,The chair leg was kicked at with Luke's toe of his leather half-boot.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information provided:

**Premise:** ""Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.""
- Subject: Luke
- Action: kicked at the chair leg
- Instrument: with the toe of his leather half-boot

**Hypothesis:** ""The chair leg was kicked at with Luke's toe of his leather half-boot.""
- Subject: The chair leg (passive construction)
- Action: was kicked at
- Instrument: with Luke's toe of his leather half-boot

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**
1. **Subject Comparison:**
   - Premise: Luke
   - Hypothesis: The chair leg (passive construction, but still refers to the same event)

2. **Action Comparison:**
   - Premise: kicked at the chair leg
   - Hypothesis: was kicked at (passive form of the same action)

3. **Instrument Comparison:**
   - Premise: with the toe of his leather half-boot
   - Hypothesis: with Luke's toe of his leather half-boot

The Hypothesis is a passive rephrasing of the Premise. It conveys the same event and details without adding or contradicting any information.

**Conclusion:**
The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

**Relation: 0**",**Relation: 0**,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He looked down and poked at the keyboard.,He was typing on his computer.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He looked down and poked at the keyboard.""
   - This statement describes an action where someone is interacting with a keyboard by poking at it.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""He was typing on his computer.""
   - This statement suggests that the person was engaged in the activity of typing on a computer.

3. **Analysis**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the action described in the Premise must definitively imply the action in the Hypothesis. Poking at the keyboard does not definitively mean typing; it could be a different form of interaction (e.g., pressing random keys, testing the keyboard, etc.).
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it is not definitively true. Poking at the keyboard could be part of typing, but it is not certain.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the action described in the Premise must make the action in the Hypothesis impossible. Poking at the keyboard does not make typing impossible; it could be part of the typing process.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relationship is **Neutral (1)** because the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He looked down and poked at the keyboard.,He looked up at his computer screen.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He looked down and poked at the keyboard.""
   - This indicates that the person is looking down and interacting with the keyboard.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""He looked up at his computer screen.""
   - This suggests that the person is looking up at the computer screen.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the person is looking down and interacting with the keyboard.
   - The Hypothesis states that the person is looking up at the computer screen.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are mutually exclusive in terms of direction of gaze (down vs. up).
   - If the person is looking down at the keyboard, they cannot simultaneously be looking up at the computer screen.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He looked down and poked at the keyboard.,He looked down and made poking motions in the direction of the keyboard.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""He looked down and poked at the keyboard.""
Hypothesis: ""He looked down and made poking motions in the direction of the keyboard.""

1. **Compare Actions**:
   - Premise: ""poked at the keyboard""
   - Hypothesis: ""made poking motions in the direction of the keyboard""

2. **Compare Context**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action of looking down and interacting with the keyboard.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the action described in the Premise but does not change its meaning.

3. **Determine Relationship**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not leave room for uncertainty; it is a rephrasing of the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and does not introduce any new or contradictory information, the relationship is one of **Entailment**.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.,Mary Elizabeth was testing the softness of the potatoes.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.""
   - This sentence describes an action where Mary Elizabeth jumped up and then poked at the potatoes.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Mary Elizabeth was testing the softness of the potatoes.""
   - This sentence suggests that the action of poking at the potatoes was done to test their softness.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state the reason why Mary Elizabeth poked at the potatoes. It only describes the action.
   - The Hypothesis provides a possible reason for the action described in the Premise, but this reason is not confirmed by the Premise itself.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not confirm or deny the reason provided in the Hypothesis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.,Mary Elizabeth stared at the potatoes but made no move towards them.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.""
   - This indicates that Mary Elizabeth actively engaged with the potatoes by jumping up and poking at them.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Mary Elizabeth stared at the potatoes but made no move towards them.""
   - This suggests that Mary Elizabeth did not engage with the potatoes physically; she only stared at them without making any movement towards them.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Mary Elizabeth took physical action towards the potatoes (jumped up and poked).
   - The Hypothesis states that Mary Elizabeth did not take any physical action towards the potatoes (stared but made no move).

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are mutually exclusive. If Mary Elizabeth poked at the potatoes, she must have moved towards them, which directly contradicts the Hypothesis that she made no move towards them.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.,The potatoes were poked at as Mary Elizabeth jumped up.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""The potatoes were poked at as Mary Elizabeth jumped up.""

- **Step 1: Check for Entailment (0)**
  - The Hypothesis states that the potatoes were poked at while Mary Elizabeth jumped up.
  - The Premise states that Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.
  - The actions described in the Hypothesis are consistent with the actions described in the Premise. The order of actions is the same, and the actions themselves are the same.
  - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

- **Step 2: Check for Contradiction (2)**
  - There is no information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise. Both statements describe the same actions in the same order.

- **Step 3: Check for Neutral (1)**
  - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, it cannot be neutral.

Based on the analysis, the correct relation is:

conative,partial,I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.,I had a straw in my cold drink.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker interacted with ice cubes in their drink, specifically by poking at them.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I had a straw in my cold drink.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker had a straw in their drink, which is described as cold.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise does not mention anything about a straw. It only mentions the presence of ice cubes and the action of poking at them.
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information (the presence of a straw) that is not addressed in the Premise.
   - The presence of ice cubes implies that the drink is likely cold, but it does not necessarily imply the presence of a straw.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the presence of a straw, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.,I left the ice cubes in my drink alone.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.""
   - This indicates that the speaker interacted with the ice cubes by poking them.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I left the ice cubes in my drink alone.""
   - This suggests that the speaker did not interact with the ice cubes at all.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker poked at the ice cubes, which is a form of interaction.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker left the ice cubes alone, which means no interaction.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are mutually exclusive. If the speaker poked at the ice cubes, they did not leave them alone. Conversely, if they left the ice cubes alone, they did not poke at them.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.,I moved around ice cubes in my drink.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.""
   - This statement describes an action where the speaker is interacting with the ice cubes in their drink by poking at them.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I moved around ice cubes in my drink.""
   - This statement describes an action where the speaker is moving the ice cubes around in their drink.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Poking at the ice cubes can be considered a way of moving them around. When you poke at something, it generally results in some movement.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise. Instead, it can be seen as a rephrasing or a more general description of the action described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the action of poking at the ice cubes can be interpreted as moving them around, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

Final answer:

conative,partial,Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.,Marco had been up very high on a ladder.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.""
   - This statement tells us that Marco was on a ladder and lost his balance, prompting him to grab the railing.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Marco had been up very high on a ladder.""
   - This statement suggests that Marco was at a significant height on the ladder.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not specify the height at which Marco was on the ladder. It only mentions that he lost his balance and grabbed the railing.
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information about the height (""very high"") which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide any information about the height, we cannot definitively conclude that Marco was ""very high"" on the ladder.
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise because the height is not specified.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.,Marco maintained balance and didn't need the ladder railing.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.""
Hypothesis: ""Marco maintained balance and didn't need the ladder railing.""

1. **Identify the key actions and states in the Premise:**
   - Marco lost his balance.
   - Marco grabbed at the ladder railing.

2. **Identify the key actions and states in the Hypothesis:**
   - Marco maintained balance.
   - Marco didn't need the ladder railing.

3. **Compare the actions and states between the Premise and the Hypothesis:**
   - The Premise states that Marco lost his balance, while the Hypothesis states that Marco maintained balance. These two statements are directly contradictory.
   - The Premise states that Marco grabbed at the ladder railing, while the Hypothesis states that Marco didn't need the ladder railing. These two statements are also directly contradictory.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the actions and states described in the Premise, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.,Marco grabbed at the ladder railing as he lost his balance.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.
Hypothesis: Marco grabbed at the ladder railing as he lost his balance.

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that Marco lost his balance and then grabbed at the ladder railing.
   - The Hypothesis states that Marco grabbed at the ladder railing as he lost his balance.

2. **Temporal and Causal Relationship**:
   - The Premise implies a sequence of events: first, Marco lost his balance, and then he grabbed at the ladder railing.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that the two actions (grabbing the railing and losing balance) happened simultaneously or in close succession.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise. It is plausible that Marco grabbed the railing as he was losing his balance, which aligns with the sequence of events described in the Premise.

4. **Rephrasing Check**:
   - The Hypothesis can be seen as a rephrasing of the Premise with a slight emphasis on the simultaneity of the actions rather than a strict sequence.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.,I tried to fix the springs in the toy.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.""
   - This sentence describes an action where the speaker is applying pressure to the springs using their hands.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I tried to fix the springs in the toy.""
   - This sentence suggests that the speaker's intention was to repair or adjust the springs in a toy.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly mention the intention behind pushing the springs. It only describes the physical action.
   - The Hypothesis introduces an additional element of intention (trying to fix the springs) and specifies that the springs are part of a toy, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the Hypothesis is true. In this case, the Premise does not provide enough information to conclude that the speaker was trying to fix the springs or that the springs are part of a toy.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The action of pushing the springs could be part of an attempt to fix them, but it is not necessarily so. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the intention or the context (toy).
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that directly conflicts with the Hypothesis. There is no direct conflict here; the Premise does not rule out the possibility that the speaker was trying to fix the springs in a toy.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.,I released the springs with the tips of my fingers.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.""
   - This indicates an action where the speaker is applying force to the springs using the palms of their hands.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I released the springs with the tips of my fingers.""
   - This indicates a different action where the speaker is releasing the springs using the tips of their fingers.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are different: pushing with palms vs. releasing with fingers.
   - The body parts used are different: palms vs. fingers.
   - The actions are not complementary or sequential; they are distinct and separate actions.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis cannot be inferred from the Premise because the actions and the body parts used are different.
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the action described in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.,I pushed the palms of my hands against the springs.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.""
Hypothesis: ""I pushed the palms of my hands against the springs.""

1. **Identify the actions and objects in both sentences:**
   - Premise: The action is ""pushed at,"" and the objects involved are ""the springs"" and ""the palms of my hands.""
   - Hypothesis: The action is ""pushed,"" and the objects involved are ""the palms of my hands"" and ""the springs.""

2. **Compare the actions:**
   - The action ""pushed at"" in the Premise is very similar to ""pushed"" in the Hypothesis. Both imply applying force to the springs using the palms of the hands.

3. **Compare the objects:**
   - Both sentences involve ""the palms of my hands"" and ""the springs."" The order of mentioning these objects is slightly different, but the meaning remains the same.

4. **Determine if the Hypothesis is definitely true, possibly true, or definitely false given the Premise:**
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the action described in the Premise without changing its meaning. The action and the objects involved are consistent between the two sentences.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Relation: 0",Relation: 0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.,His belly pushed at the buttons of the hotel elevator through his shirt.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.
Hypothesis: His belly pushed at the buttons of the hotel elevator through his shirt.

1. **Identify the main elements in the Premise:**
   - His belly
   - Pushed at the buttons
   - White and blue Aloha shirt

2. **Identify the main elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - His belly
   - Pushed at the buttons
   - Hotel elevator
   - Through his shirt

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - The Premise talks about the buttons of his shirt being pushed by his belly.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new element, the hotel elevator, and suggests that his belly pushed the buttons of the elevator through his shirt.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Premise does not mention anything about a hotel elevator. It only talks about the buttons of his shirt.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a scenario that is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise because the Premise does not provide any information about an elevator or pushing elevator buttons through his shirt. The two scenarios are different and cannot coexist based on the given information.

Therefore, the relation is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.,The white and blue Aloha shirt hung on his thin frame.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.""
- This suggests that the person is likely overweight or has a large belly, causing the buttons of the shirt to be strained or pushed.

Hypothesis: ""The white and blue Aloha shirt hung on his thin frame.""
- This suggests that the person is thin, and the shirt is loose on him.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:
1. **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis must be definitely true given the Premise. In this case, the Premise suggests a large belly, while the Hypothesis suggests a thin frame. These two descriptions are contradictory.
2. **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. This is not applicable here because the descriptions are directly opposing.
3. **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. Since a large belly pushing at the buttons contradicts a thin frame with a loose shirt, this is the correct relationship.

Therefore, the relation is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.,The white and blue Aloha shirt buttons stretched over his belly.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.""
Hypothesis: ""The white and blue Aloha shirt buttons stretched over his belly.""

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The Premise describes a situation where the person's belly is pushing against the buttons of a white and blue Aloha shirt.
   - The Hypothesis describes the buttons of the white and blue Aloha shirt being stretched over the person's belly.

2. **Semantic Comparison**:
   - The action of the belly pushing at the buttons (Premise) implies that the buttons are under strain or being stretched (Hypothesis).
   - Both statements describe the same scenario from slightly different perspectives but convey the same underlying situation: the buttons are being affected by the belly.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - If the belly is pushing at the buttons, it is logical to infer that the buttons are being stretched over the belly.
   - There is no contradiction between the two statements; rather, the Hypothesis is a natural consequence of the Premise.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He pushed at the doorbell.,He wanted to see if someone was home.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He pushed at the doorbell.""
   - This statement describes an action where someone is pressing the doorbell.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""He wanted to see if someone was home.""
   - This statement suggests a possible reason for the action described in the premise.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis provides a possible motivation for the action in the Premise. It is plausible that someone would push a doorbell to check if someone is home.
   - However, the Premise does not explicitly state the reason for pushing the doorbell. There could be other reasons for this action (e.g., delivering a package, playing a prank, etc.).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis is not definitively true based on the Premise alone, as there are multiple possible reasons for pushing a doorbell.
   - Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

The correct numerical value for the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He pushed at the doorbell.,He hovered over the doorbell.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""He pushed at the doorbell.""
   - This indicates that the person made physical contact with the doorbell and applied pressure to it.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""He hovered over the doorbell.""
   - This suggests that the person was near the doorbell but did not make physical contact with it.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise states that the person pushed the doorbell, which involves physical contact and action.
   - The Hypothesis states that the person hovered over the doorbell, which implies no physical contact and no action of pushing.

4. **Inference:**
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are mutually exclusive. If someone is pushing the doorbell, they cannot be merely hovering over it at the same time.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He pushed at the doorbell.,The doorbell was pushed at by him.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He pushed at the doorbell.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""The doorbell was pushed at by him.""

- The Premise states that ""He pushed at the doorbell.""
- The Hypothesis states that ""The doorbell was pushed at by him.""

Both sentences describe the same action but in different syntactic structures. The Hypothesis is a passive construction of the active sentence in the Premise. The meaning conveyed by both sentences is identical.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship is:

0 – Entailment

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.",I had a mark on my body I needed to wash off.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.""
   - This indicates that the speaker used a washcloth, made it wet, and then rubbed a mark.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I had a mark on my body I needed to wash off.""
   - This suggests that the speaker had a mark on their body that they intended to clean.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state where the mark is located. It only mentions that the speaker rubbed at a mark after wetting a washcloth.
   - The Hypothesis adds the detail that the mark is on the speaker's body and that it needed to be washed off.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is a plausible explanation for the actions described in the Premise, but it is not definitively confirmed by the Premise. The Premise could be referring to a mark on any surface, not necessarily the speaker's body.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.",I took a dry washcloth and hovered over the mark.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.""
Hypothesis: ""I took a dry washcloth and hovered over the mark.""

1. **Action with the Washcloth:**
   - Premise: The washcloth is wet.
   - Hypothesis: The washcloth is dry.
   - These two statements are contradictory because a washcloth cannot be both wet and dry at the same time.

2. **Action on the Mark:**
   - Premise: The action is rubbing at the mark.
   - Hypothesis: The action is hovering over the mark.
   - These actions are different. Rubbing implies direct contact and movement, while hovering implies no contact.

Given these points, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the actions described in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.",I rubbed at the mark with a wet washcloth.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.""
Hypothesis: ""I rubbed at the mark with a wet washcloth.""

1. **Identify the actions in the Premise:**
   - The speaker took a washcloth.
   - The speaker wet the washcloth.
   - The speaker rubbed at the mark.

2. **Identify the actions in the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker rubbed at the mark with a wet washcloth.

3. **Compare the actions and details:**
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker rubbed at the mark with a wet washcloth.
   - The Premise provides a sequence of actions that lead to the same conclusion: the washcloth was wet, and then the speaker rubbed at the mark.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is a direct restatement of the final outcome described in the Premise.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction between the two statements.
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.,He had a fresh bite on his neck.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.""
   - This indicates that there is a bite wound on his throat, and it is described as ""raw,"" which implies it is fresh or recent.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""He had a fresh bite on his neck.""
   - This suggests that he has a fresh bite on his neck.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions a ""raw bite wound"" on his ""throat.""
   - The Hypothesis mentions a ""fresh bite"" on his ""neck.""

4. **Analysis**:
   - The terms ""raw"" and ""fresh"" are synonymous in this context, both indicating that the wound is recent.
   - The ""throat"" is part of the ""neck,"" so the locations mentioned are consistent with each other.

Given that the information in the Hypothesis is directly supported by the information in the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship is:

**0 – Entailment**

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.,His rubbing came nowhere close to the raw bite wound on his throat.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.""
   - This statement indicates that the subject is physically touching and rubbing a specific area, which is the raw bite wound on his throat.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""His rubbing came nowhere close to the raw bite wound on his throat.""
   - This statement suggests that the subject's rubbing did not come near the raw bite wound on his throat, implying that the rubbing occurred in a different location.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the rubbing is directly on the raw bite wound.
   - The Hypothesis states that the rubbing did not come close to the raw bite wound.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the Premise is true (rubbing on the wound), then the Hypothesis (rubbing not near the wound) cannot be true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.,His throat had a raw bite wound he rubbed at.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: ""He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.""
Hypothesis: ""His throat had a raw bite wound he rubbed at.""

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.""
   - The Hypothesis states that ""His throat had a raw bite wound he rubbed at.""

2. **Information Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention a ""raw bite wound"" on ""his throat.""
   - Both statements indicate that ""he rubbed at"" this wound.

3. **Order and Paraphrasing**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. The order of the information is slightly different, but the meaning remains the same.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the same information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I rubbed at the ache in my neck.,I slept on my neck wrong.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I rubbed at the ache in my neck.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker is experiencing an ache in their neck and is rubbing it.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I slept on my neck wrong.""
   - This statement suggests a possible cause for the ache in the neck, implying that the speaker might have slept in an awkward position.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

- **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must definitively imply that the speaker slept on their neck wrong. However, the Premise only mentions the action of rubbing the neck due to an ache, without providing any information about the cause of the ache.

- **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it is not necessarily true. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the cause of the ache. The ache could be due to various reasons, not just sleeping wrong.

- **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly conflicts with the idea that the speaker slept on their neck wrong. The Premise does not provide such conflicting information.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relationship is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I rubbed at the ache in my neck.,I didn't touch my alleviated neck.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""I rubbed at the ache in my neck.""
Hypothesis: ""I didn't touch my alleviated neck.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The speaker is describing an action where they are rubbing at an ache in their neck. This implies physical contact with the neck.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The speaker is stating that they did not touch their neck, which is described as alleviated (implying the ache is gone or reduced).

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise indicates that the speaker did touch their neck.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker did not touch their neck.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise because the Premise clearly states that the speaker rubbed their neck, which involves touching it, while the Hypothesis states the opposite.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,I rubbed at the ache in my neck.,I had an ache in my neck I rubbed at.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I rubbed at the ache in my neck.""
Hypothesis: ""I had an ache in my neck I rubbed at.""

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker rubbed at an ache in their neck.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker had an ache in their neck and rubbed at it.

2. **Information Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same information: the presence of an ache in the neck and the action of rubbing it.
   - The order of the information is slightly different, but the meaning remains unchanged.

3. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because it restates the same information in a slightly different order.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.,Lily was wearing a decorated dress.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.""
   - This statement tells us that Lily is interacting with ribbons that are on her dress.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Lily was wearing a decorated dress.""
   - This statement suggests that Lily's dress has decorations.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise mentions that there are ribbons on Lily's dress, which can be considered a form of decoration.
   - The Hypothesis states that Lily's dress is decorated, which is a broader statement that includes the possibility of having ribbons as decorations.

4. **Inference**:
   - Given that the Premise specifies ribbons on the dress, it logically follows that the dress is decorated (since ribbons are a type of decoration).
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.,Lily made no attempt to touch the ribbons on her dress.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.""
Hypothesis: ""Lily made no attempt to touch the ribbons on her dress.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that Lily interacted with the ribbons on her dress by plucking at them.
2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis claims that Lily did not make any attempt to touch the ribbons on her dress.
3. **Comparing the Statements**: The Premise clearly indicates that Lily did touch the ribbons, while the Hypothesis states the opposite, that she did not touch them at all.

Given this direct contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.,There were ribbons on Lily's dress she plucked at.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.""
   - This statement tells us that Lily interacted with ribbons that were on her dress.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""There were ribbons on Lily's dress she plucked at.""
   - This statement is essentially a rephrasing of the premise. It states that there were ribbons on Lily's dress and that she plucked at them.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis directly restates the information given in the Premise.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis.
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He stabbed at the last part of the equation.,The last part of the equation was the most complex.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He stabbed at the last part of the equation.""
   - This suggests that he was focusing on or working on the last part of the equation, possibly with some difficulty or frustration.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""The last part of the equation was the most complex.""
   - This suggests that the last part of the equation had a higher level of difficulty or complexity compared to other parts.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not provide any explicit information about the complexity of the last part of the equation. It only indicates that he was working on it.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new piece of information (the complexity of the last part) that is not directly supported or refuted by the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not confirm or deny the complexity of the last part of the equation, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the given information.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He stabbed at the last part of the equation.,He drew attention away from the last part of the equation.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He stabbed at the last part of the equation.""
   - This suggests that he focused on or made an effort to address the last part of the equation.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""He drew attention away from the last part of the equation.""
   - This suggests that he diverted focus away from the last part of the equation.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates an action of focusing on the last part of the equation.
   - The Hypothesis indicates an action of diverting focus away from the last part of the equation.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are directly contradictory. If he is focusing on the last part of the equation, he cannot simultaneously be drawing attention away from it.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the appropriate numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He stabbed at the last part of the equation.,He made a stabbing gesture towards the last part of the equation.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""He stabbed at the last part of the equation.""
   - This suggests that he made a stabbing motion or gesture towards the last part of the equation.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""He made a stabbing gesture towards the last part of the equation.""
   - This explicitly states that he made a stabbing gesture towards the last part of the equation.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis are essentially describing the same action. The Premise uses the phrase ""stabbed at,"" which can be interpreted as making a stabbing gesture. The Hypothesis clarifies this by explicitly stating ""made a stabbing gesture.""

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - Since the Hypothesis is a direct restatement of the action described in the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.,I tried to drink the last bits of the slushee with my straw.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.""
Hypothesis: ""I tried to drink the last bits of the slushee with my straw.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The speaker removed the plastic dome from their drink.
   - The speaker then used a straw to stab at the slush in the drink.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker attempted to drink the remaining parts of the slushee using a straw.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The action of ""stabbing at the slush with the straw"" in the Premise can be interpreted as an attempt to drink the slush, which aligns with the Hypothesis.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a plausible interpretation of the actions described in the Premise.

4. **Determining the Relation:**
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because the actions described in the Premise logically lead to the conclusion in the Hypothesis.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.,I kept the lid on my drink and slurped the slush with my straw.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.""
   - The speaker removed the plastic dome (lid) from their drink.
   - The speaker used the straw to stab at the slush.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I kept the lid on my drink and slurped the slush with my straw.""
   - The speaker kept the lid on their drink.
   - The speaker used the straw to slurp the slush.

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Lid Status**: The Premise states that the lid was removed, while the Hypothesis states that the lid was kept on. These two statements are directly contradictory.
   - **Action with Straw**: The Premise states that the speaker stabbed at the slush with the straw, while the Hypothesis states that the speaker slurped the slush with the straw. These actions are different but not necessarily contradictory on their own. However, combined with the lid status, they contribute to the overall contradiction.

Given that the Premise and Hypothesis provide directly opposing information about the status of the lid, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.,I stabbed at the slush with the straw after I took the lid off my drink.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.""
Hypothesis: ""I stabbed at the slush with the straw after I took the lid off my drink.""

1. **Identify the actions in the Premise:**
   - Action 1: ""I took the plastic dome from my drink.""
   - Action 2: ""I stabbed at the slush with the straw.""

2. **Identify the actions in the Hypothesis:**
   - Action 1: ""I took the lid off my drink.""
   - Action 2: ""I stabbed at the slush with the straw.""

3. **Compare the actions:**
   - The Hypothesis states the same actions as the Premise but uses ""lid"" instead of ""plastic dome,"" which is a synonymous term in this context.
   - The order of actions in the Hypothesis is the same as in the Premise: first, the lid (plastic dome) is removed, and then the slush is stabbed with the straw.

4. **Determine the temporal relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states the temporal relationship with ""after,"" which is implied in the Premise by the sequence of actions.

5. **Check for consistency:**
   - The actions and their order in the Hypothesis are consistent with those in the Premise.

Since the Hypothesis restates the actions and their order from the Premise accurately, it is definitely true given the Premise.

conative,partial,"She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.","She enjoyed a cup of hot coffee, as it warmed her face and hands.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.
Hypothesis: She enjoyed a cup of hot coffee, as it warmed her face and hands.

1. **Identify the actions and states in the Premise:**
   - She took the cup.
   - She sipped at the coffee.
   - She closed her eyes.
   - She breathed in the steam.

2. **Identify the actions and states in the Hypothesis:**
   - She enjoyed a cup of hot coffee.
   - The coffee warmed her face and hands.

3. **Compare the actions and states:**
   - The Premise describes actions that suggest she is savoring the coffee (sipping, closing her eyes, breathing in the steam), which can imply enjoyment.
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states that she enjoyed the coffee and that it warmed her face and hands.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Premise does not explicitly mention that the coffee warmed her face and hands, but it does suggest enjoyment through her actions.
   - The Hypothesis adds details (warming her face and hands) that are not directly stated in the Premise but are plausible given the context of enjoying hot coffee.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The Hypothesis is not definitively true based on the Premise alone, as the warming of her face and hands is an additional detail not mentioned.
   - However, the Hypothesis is also not contradicted by the Premise; it is a plausible scenario.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as Neutral.

conative,partial,"She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.","She took the cold cup and didn't drink it, realizing her coffee was cold.",2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.""

### Hypothesis:
""She took the cold cup and didn't drink it, realizing her coffee was cold.""

### Analysis:
1. **Action in the Premise**:
   - She took the cup.
   - She sipped at the coffee.
   - She closed her eyes.
   - She breathed in the steam.

2. **Action in the Hypothesis**:
   - She took the cold cup.
   - She didn't drink it.
   - She realized her coffee was cold.

### Comparison:
- **Taking the cup**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that she took the cup.
- **Temperature of the cup**: The Premise does not mention the temperature of the cup, but the Hypothesis specifies that the cup is cold.
- **Drinking the coffee**: The Premise states she sipped at the coffee, which means she drank it. The Hypothesis states she didn't drink it.
- **Realization of the coffee being cold**: The Premise does not mention anything about the coffee being cold or her realizing it.

### Conclusion:
- The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise in terms of her drinking the coffee. The Premise states she sipped at the coffee, while the Hypothesis states she didn't drink it.
- The Hypothesis introduces new information about the coffee being cold, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

Given these points, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because the actions described (sipping the coffee vs. not drinking it) are mutually exclusive.

### Final Decision:
The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

**Relation: 2**",**Relation: 2**,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.","She took the cup and closed her eyes, as she breathed in the steam of her cup of coffee she was sipping.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's break down the information step by step:

Premise: She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.
Hypothesis: She took the cup and closed her eyes, as she breathed in the steam of her cup of coffee she was sipping.

1. **Identify the actions in the Premise:**
   - She took the cup.
   - She sipped at the coffee.
   - She closed her eyes.
   - She breathed in the steam.

2. **Identify the actions in the Hypothesis:**
   - She took the cup.
   - She closed her eyes.
   - She breathed in the steam of her cup of coffee.
   - She was sipping.

3. **Compare the actions and their sequence:**
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis mention that she took the cup.
   - Both mention that she closed her eyes.
   - Both mention that she breathed in the steam.
   - Both mention that she was sipping the coffee.

4. **Check for consistency and completeness:**
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the actions in the Premise but does not introduce any new information or contradict any part of the Premise.
   - The sequence of actions in the Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise.

Since the Hypothesis restates the actions described in the Premise without adding or contradicting any information, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I sipped at the Heineken.,I had a bottle of beer.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""I sipped at the Heineken.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker took a sip from a Heineken, which is a brand of beer.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""I had a bottle of beer.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker possessed and presumably drank from a bottle of beer.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The Premise specifies the brand of beer (Heineken) and the action (sipping).
   - The Hypothesis generalizes the type of drink (beer) without specifying the brand or the action.

4. **Inference:**
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise because if someone sips at a Heineken, it implies they have a bottle of beer (since Heineken is a type of beer).
   - The Hypothesis is not necessarily entailed by the Premise because the Premise does not explicitly state that the beer was in a bottle (it could be in a can, glass, etc.), but it is a reasonable assumption.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, but it is not definitively true or false based on the information provided.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I sipped at the Heineken.,I spit out the Heineken.,2,"Let's analyze the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I sipped at the Heineken.""
   - This indicates that the speaker took a sip of the Heineken.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I spit out the Heineken.""
   - This indicates that the speaker spit out the Heineken after presumably having it in their mouth.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The act of sipping at the Heineken (Premise) and the act of spitting out the Heineken (Hypothesis) are contradictory actions. If someone sips a drink, it implies they are ingesting it, at least temporarily. Spitting it out implies rejection or expulsion of the drink.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because sipping and spitting out are mutually exclusive actions in this context.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,I sipped at the Heineken.,I had some Heineken.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""I sipped at the Heineken.""
2. **Hypothesis:** ""I had some Heineken.""

- **Entailment (0):** The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. If someone sips at a Heineken, it means they have had some Heineken. Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.
- **Neutral (1):** The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. This is not applicable here because the act of sipping directly implies having some of the drink.
- **Contradiction (2):** The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. This is not applicable because there is no contradiction between sipping at a Heineken and having some Heineken.

Given the analysis, the correct relationship is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.,He toasted together with everyone using glasses of champagne.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.""
   - This indicates that the subject participated in a communal activity involving raising a glass and sipping champagne.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He toasted together with everyone using glasses of champagne.""
   - This suggests that the subject participated in a toast with others, using glasses of champagne.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a communal activity involving glasses of champagne.
   - The act of raising a glass and sipping champagne can be reasonably interpreted as part of a toast.
   - There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the Hypothesis.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because raising a glass and sipping champagne with everyone else is a common way to describe a toast.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.,He lowered his glass and didn't sip the champagne with everyone else.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.""
Hypothesis: ""He lowered his glass and didn't sip the champagne with everyone else.""

1. **Identify the actions in the Premise:**
   - He raised his glass.
   - He sipped at the champagne.
   - He did this with everyone else.

2. **Identify the actions in the Hypothesis:**
   - He lowered his glass.
   - He didn't sip the champagne.
   - He didn't do this with everyone else.

3. **Compare the actions:**
   - The Premise states that he raised his glass, while the Hypothesis states that he lowered his glass. These actions are opposites.
   - The Premise states that he sipped the champagne, while the Hypothesis states that he didn't sip the champagne. These actions are also opposites.
   - The Premise states that he did this with everyone else, while the Hypothesis states that he didn't do this with everyone else. These actions are contradictory.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict the actions described in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.,"With everyone else, he tasted the champagne and raised his glass.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.""
Hypothesis: ""With everyone else, he tasted the champagne and raised his glass.""

1. **Identify the actions in the Premise:**
   - He raised his glass.
   - He sipped at the champagne.
   - He did these actions with everyone else.

2. **Identify the actions in the Hypothesis:**
   - He tasted the champagne.
   - He raised his glass.
   - He did these actions with everyone else.

3. **Compare the actions and their order:**
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis mention raising the glass and tasting/sipping the champagne.
   - Both actions are done with everyone else.
   - The order of actions is slightly different, but the meaning remains the same.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the actions in the Premise but does not change the meaning.
   - The actions and context are consistent between the Premise and Hypothesis.

Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Phil nibbled at the cake.,Phil was too full for cake.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Phil nibbled at the cake.""
   - This indicates that Phil ate a small amount of cake.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Phil was too full for cake.""
   - This suggests that Phil was so full that he couldn't eat any cake.

3. **Comparison**:
   - If Phil nibbled at the cake, it means he did eat some cake, even if it was just a small amount.
   - The Hypothesis states that Phil was too full to eat any cake, which directly contradicts the action described in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship is a contradiction.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Phil nibbled at the cake.,Phil didn't try the cake.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""Phil nibbled at the cake.""
Hypothesis: ""Phil didn't try the cake.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that Phil nibbled at the cake. This means that Phil did indeed have some interaction with the cake, specifically by nibbling at it.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that Phil didn't try the cake. This implies that Phil had no interaction with the cake.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise indicates that Phil did interact with the cake (nibbled at it).
   - The Hypothesis indicates that Phil did not interact with the cake (didn't try it).

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - Since the Premise clearly states that Phil nibbled at the cake, it directly contradicts the Hypothesis which states that Phil didn't try the cake.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Phil nibbled at the cake.,Phil ate some cake.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Phil nibbled at the cake.""
   - This means Phil took small bites of the cake.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Phil ate some cake.""
   - This means Phil consumed some portion of the cake.

3. **Analysis**:
   - If Phil nibbled at the cake, it implies that he ate some portion of it, even if it was in small amounts.
   - The act of nibbling inherently involves eating, though in small quantities.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis ""Phil ate some cake"" is definitely true if the Premise ""Phil nibbled at the cake"" is true.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.",He didn't realize how hungry he was for food.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.""
   - This indicates that initially, he was eating the filet slowly or cautiously (nibbling), but then he started eating it very quickly and eagerly (ravenously).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He didn't realize how hungry he was for food.""
   - This suggests that he was unaware of his own hunger until he started eating.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a change in eating behavior from nibbling to eating ravenously, which can imply that he might have been hungrier than he initially thought.
   - The Hypothesis states that he didn't realize his hunger, which aligns with the behavior described in the Premise (starting slow and then eating quickly).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a plausible explanation for the behavior described in the Premise.
   - The Premise does not explicitly confirm the Hypothesis, but it does not contradict it either.
   - The Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise but is not definitively proven by it.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as **Neutral**.

Therefore, the appropriate numerical value is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.","He took big bites of the filet, then slowed down.",2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.""
- This means he started by eating small bites (nibbling) and then proceeded to eat with great enthusiasm (ravenously).

Hypothesis: ""He took big bites of the filet, then slowed down.""
- This means he started by eating large bites and then reduced his eating speed.

Now, let's compare the two statements:
1. The Premise describes a progression from small bites to enthusiastic eating.
2. The Hypothesis describes a progression from large bites to slower eating.

These two progressions are opposite in nature:
- The Premise starts slow and ends fast.
- The Hypothesis starts fast and ends slow.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because they describe opposite sequences of eating behavior.

Therefore, the relationship is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2

Premise: ""He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.""
Hypothesis: ""He ate ravenously, after small bites of the filet.""

1. **Identify the actions in the Premise:**
   - ""He nibbled at the filet"" (small bites)
   - ""then ate ravenously"" (ate a lot quickly)

2. **Identify the actions in the Hypothesis:**
   - ""He ate ravenously"" (ate a lot quickly)
   - ""after small bites of the filet"" (small bites)

3. **Compare the sequence of actions:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of actions: small bites followed by eating ravenously.

4. **Check for consistency:**
   - The Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise. It rephrases the same sequence of actions described in the Premise.

Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.","She had worn lipstick that day, not knowing she would be kissed.",1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.""
- This indicates that she was wearing lipstick, and after kissing her, he brushed at the lipstick mark she left.

Hypothesis: ""She had worn lipstick that day, not knowing she would be kissed.""
- This suggests that she wore lipstick without the anticipation of being kissed.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

1. **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise directly implies it. The Premise confirms she wore lipstick, but it does not provide information about her knowledge or expectations regarding being kissed.

2. **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise confirms she wore lipstick, but it does not address whether she knew she would be kissed or not. Therefore, the Hypothesis is plausible but not certain based on the Premise.

3. **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise directly contradicts it. The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis; it simply does not provide enough information about her knowledge or expectations.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relationship is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.",He didn't touch her because of the lipstick she had that would smear on him.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.""
- This indicates that he did kiss her and then took action to brush off the lipstick she left on him.

Hypothesis: ""He didn't touch her because of the lipstick she had that would smear on him.""
- This suggests that he avoided touching her due to the lipstick she had, which would smear on him.

Now, let's compare the two statements:

1. The Premise states that he did kiss her.
2. The Hypothesis states that he didn't touch her.

These two statements are directly contradictory. The Premise confirms an action (kissing), while the Hypothesis denies it (not touching).

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.","He wiped at the lipstick he knew she had left behind, after he had kissed her in return.",0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.""
   - This indicates two actions:
     1. He kissed her in return.
     2. He brushed at the lipstick she left behind.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He wiped at the lipstick he knew she had left behind, after he had kissed her in return.""
   - This also indicates two actions:
     1. He kissed her in return.
     2. He wiped at the lipstick she left behind.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of events: he kissed her in return and then dealt with the lipstick she left behind.
   - The actions described (brushed vs. wiped) are similar enough to be considered equivalent in this context.
   - The order of actions is the same in both the Premise and the Hypothesis.

Given that the Hypothesis restates the Premise with synonymous actions and maintains the same sequence of events, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.",She had long hair past her shoulders that he moved away.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.""
   - This indicates that he observed her face and moved some hair that was falling over her shoulders.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She had long hair past her shoulders that he moved away.""
   - This suggests that she had long hair that extended past her shoulders, and he moved it away.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions that he brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders, which implies that her hair was long enough to fall over her shoulders.
   - The Hypothesis states that she had long hair past her shoulders and that he moved it away, which aligns with the action described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because the action of brushing at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders directly supports the idea that she had long hair past her shoulders and that he moved it away.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.",He didn't look her in the face or touch her hair that tumbled over her shoulders.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.""
   - This indicates that he looked at her face and touched her hair.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""He didn't look her in the face or touch her hair that tumbled over her shoulders.""
   - This states that he neither looked at her face nor touched her hair.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that he did both actions: looked at her face and touched her hair.
   - The Hypothesis states that he did neither of these actions.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the Premise is true, the Hypothesis cannot be true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:

conative,partial,"He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.","As he studied her face, he made a brushing movement at the hair tumbling over her shoulders.",0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.""
   - This sentence describes two actions performed by ""he"": studying her face and brushing at her hair.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""As he studied her face, he made a brushing movement at the hair tumbling over her shoulders.""
   - This sentence also describes two actions performed by ""he"": studying her face and making a brushing movement at her hair.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same two actions: studying her face and brushing at her hair.
   - The sequence and the nature of the actions are consistent between the Premise and the Hypothesis.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and does not add or contradict any information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

   - This indicates that a person was forcefully knocking or hitting the front door.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Someone was trying to get in the house.""
   - This suggests that a person was attempting to enter the house.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The act of hammering at the front door can be interpreted as an attempt to gain entry into the house. However, it is not explicitly stated in the Premise that the person was trying to get in; they could be hammering for other reasons (e.g., to get attention, out of frustration, etc.).
   - Therefore, while the Hypothesis is a plausible explanation of the Premise, it is not definitively true based on the information given.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. There is no definitive evidence in the Premise to confirm or deny the Hypothesis.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Someone hammered at the front door.,Someone didn't touch the front door.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Someone hammered at the front door.""
   - This indicates that an individual made contact with the front door by hammering on it.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Someone didn't touch the front door.""
   - This suggests that no one made any contact with the front door.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that there was contact with the front door (hammering).
   - The Hypothesis states that there was no contact with the front door.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If someone hammered at the front door, it is impossible for it to be true that no one touched the front door.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Someone hammered at the front door.,The front door was hammered by someone.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Someone hammered at the front door.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""The front door was hammered by someone.""

- **Step 1: Check for Entailment (0)**
  - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise in a passive voice but conveys the same action and subject. The action of hammering at the front door by someone is clearly stated in both the Premise and the Hypothesis.
  - Since the Hypothesis is a direct rephrasing of the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

- **Step 2: Check for Contradiction (2)**
  - There is no information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise. Both statements are consistent with each other.

- **Step 3: Check for Neutral (1)**
  - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or uncertainty that would make it only possibly true. It is a straightforward rephrasing of the Premise.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

intransitive-motion,schematic,"We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.",Charles Powell is a spokesman who is speaking on the behalf of others.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.""
   - This statement indicates that Charles Powell, who is a spokesman, made a statement about not wanting anyone to slip through the cracks.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Charles Powell is a spokesman who is speaking on the behalf of others.""
   - This statement asserts that Charles Powell is a spokesman and implies that he is speaking on behalf of others.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that Charles Powell is a spokesman.
   - The Hypothesis also states that Charles Powell is a spokesman.
   - The Hypothesis adds that he is speaking on behalf of others, which is a reasonable inference given the role of a spokesman.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is not definitively entailed by the Premise because the Premise does not explicitly state that Charles Powell is speaking on behalf of others, although it is a reasonable assumption.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,"We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.","We want people to slip through the cracks,  spokesman Charles Powell said.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.""
   - This indicates a desire to prevent people from being overlooked or neglected.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""We want people to slip through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.""
   - This indicates a desire for people to be overlooked or neglected.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise explicitly states a desire to prevent people from slipping through the cracks.
   - The hypothesis states the opposite, that there is a desire for people to slip through the cracks.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. The premise says ""don't want"" while the hypothesis says ""want,"" which are opposite intentions.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.","Spokesman Charles Powell had said, ""We don't want anyone to slip through the cracks.""",0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""Spokesman Charles Powell had said, 'We don't want anyone to slip through the cracks.'""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Content Comparison**:
  - The content of the Premise and Hypothesis is essentially the same. Both sentences convey the same message: Charles Powell, a spokesman, said that they don't want anyone to slip through the cracks.
  
- **Paraphrasing**:
  - The Hypothesis is a paraphrase of the Premise. It rephrases the statement made by Charles Powell but does not change the meaning or introduce any new information.

- **Temporal Aspect**:
  - The Hypothesis uses ""had said"" instead of ""said,"" but this does not alter the meaning of the statement. It still refers to the same event of Charles Powell making the statement.

- **Direct Quotation**:
  - The Hypothesis directly quotes the statement made by Charles Powell, which is consistent with the information provided in the Premise.

### Conclusion:
Given that the Hypothesis is a direct paraphrase and quotation of the Premise without any additional or contradictory information, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

**0 – Entailment**

### Final Output:
0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.,There is a river called the Weantic River.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.""
   - This statement tells us that there is a river named ""Weweantic River"" and it flows through a pond.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""There is a river called the Weantic River.""
   - This statement asserts the existence of a river named ""Weantic River.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions ""Weweantic River,"" while the Hypothesis mentions ""Weantic River."" The names are slightly different, which could imply a typographical error or a different river.
   - If we assume ""Weantic River"" is a typo and it should be ""Weweantic River,"" then the Hypothesis would be true given the Premise.
   - If we do not assume a typo, the Hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the Premise because it refers to a different river.

4. **Inference**:
   - Given the slight difference in the names, we cannot definitively say the Hypothesis is true based on the Premise without making an assumption about a typo.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.,The Weweantic River does not flow through the pond.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.""
   - This statement asserts that the Weweantic River flows through the pond.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The Weweantic River does not flow through the pond.""
   - This statement asserts the opposite, that the Weweantic River does not flow through the pond.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the river flows through the pond.
   - The Hypothesis states that the river does not flow through the pond.

Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise, the relationship between the two statements is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value for the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.,Water from the Weweantic River moves through the pond.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.""
   - This statement indicates that the Weweantic River has a flow that passes through a pond.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Water from the Weweantic River moves through the pond.""
   - This statement suggests that water originating from the Weweantic River is moving through the pond.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the movement of water from the Weweantic River through the pond.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise, focusing on the water from the river moving through the pond.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (it is a restatement of the same fact), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.,In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital to appeal for an end to prescription drug abuse.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.""
   - Key points: 
     - Location: Cambodia, capital Phnom Penh.
     - Action: Several hundred people marched.
     - Purpose: To appeal for an end to growing drug use.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital to appeal for an end to prescription drug abuse.""
   - Key points:
     - Location: Cambodia, capital (Phnom Penh is implied but not explicitly mentioned).
     - Action: Several hundred people marched.
     - Purpose: To appeal for an end to prescription drug abuse.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree on the location (Cambodia, capital city) and the action (several hundred people marched).
   - The difference lies in the purpose:
     - Premise: ""to appeal for an end to growing drug use.""
     - Hypothesis: ""to appeal for an end to prescription drug abuse.""

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise mentions ""growing drug use"" which is a broader term and can include various types of drug use, including prescription drug abuse.
   - The Hypothesis specifies ""prescription drug abuse,"" which is a subset of ""growing drug use.""
   - Since the Hypothesis narrows down the type of drug use but does not contradict the Premise, it is possible but not certain that the Hypothesis is true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.,In Cambodia few people walked through the capital Phnom Penh to deny an end to growing drug use.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.""
   - Key points: 
     - Several hundred people
     - Marched through the capital Phnom Penh
     - Purpose: to appeal for an end to growing drug use

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""In Cambodia few people walked through the capital Phnom Penh to deny an end to growing drug use.""
   - Key points:
     - Few people
     - Walked through the capital Phnom Penh
     - Purpose: to deny an end to growing drug use

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Number of People**: The Premise mentions ""several hundred people,"" while the Hypothesis mentions ""few people."" This is a significant difference in the number of participants.
   - **Action**: The Premise uses ""MARCHED,"" which implies a more organized and purposeful movement, while the Hypothesis uses ""walked,"" which is less specific and less organized.
   - **Purpose**: The Premise states the purpose as ""to appeal for an end to growing drug use,"" while the Hypothesis states the purpose as ""to deny an end to growing drug use."" These purposes are directly contradictory.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis contradicts the Premise in terms of the number of people, the nature of the action, and the purpose of the action.

Given these points, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.,Several hundred people marched to appeal the end of growing drug use in Cambodia through the capital Phnom Penh.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""Several hundred people marched to appeal the end of growing drug use in Cambodia through the capital Phnom Penh.""

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:
- Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention ""several hundred people"" marching.
- Both mention the purpose of the march: ""to appeal for an end to growing drug use.""
- Both specify the location: ""through the capital Phnom Penh"" and ""in Cambodia.""

The Hypothesis rephrases the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details. It essentially restates the same event with slightly different wording.

**Conclusion**:
- The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,In VERY vivid detail I remember FALLING down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door.,"The speaker had great memory of events, but not great balance since they fell down the stairs like that.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker remembers falling down the first flight of stairs in their house onto the landing in front of the main door.
   - The memory is described as ""VERY vivid,"" indicating a strong recollection of the event.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that the speaker had a great memory of events but not great balance since they fell down the stairs.
   - This hypothesis makes an inference about the speaker's memory and balance based on the event described in the premise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise confirms that the speaker has a vivid memory of a specific event (falling down the stairs).
   - The hypothesis extends this by generalizing that the speaker has a great memory of events and infers a lack of balance based on the fall.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis is making an additional assumption about the speaker's general memory and balance, which is not explicitly stated in the premise.
   - The premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the speaker's overall memory or balance capabilities.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1 – Neutral

Final output:
1",1,False,True,False,1

1. **Premise**: ""In VERY vivid detail I remember FALLING down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door.""
   - The speaker clearly remembers falling down the stairs in their house.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I don't remember at all falling down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door.""
   - The speaker claims they do not remember falling down the stairs in their house.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker remembers the event in very vivid detail.
   - The Hypothesis states the opposite, that the speaker does not remember the event at all.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the speaker remembers the event vividly, it cannot be true that they do not remember it at all.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:

intransitive-motion,schematic,In VERY vivid detail I remember FALLING down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door.,I fell down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door and I remember it all in very vivid detail.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

**Premise:** ""In VERY vivid detail I remember FALLING down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door.""

**Hypothesis:** ""I fell down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door and I remember it all in very vivid detail.""

1. **Content Comparison:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: falling down the first flight of stairs in the house onto the landing in front of the main door.
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention remembering the event in very vivid detail.

2. **Paraphrasing Check:**
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a paraphrased version of the Premise. It rephrases the same information without adding or contradicting any details.

3. **Inference Relation:**
   - Since the Hypothesis restates the same information provided in the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,"People who SPILLED over from the ""protest"" attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.",An innocent person was driving down Regent Street when their car was attacked by protestors.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""People who SPILLED over from the 'protest' attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.""
   - This indicates that individuals from a protest attacked a car on Regent Street.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""An innocent person was driving down Regent Street when their car was attacked by protestors.""
   - This suggests that a person, described as innocent, was driving on Regent Street and their car was attacked by protestors.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a car being attacked by protestors on Regent Street.
   - The Premise does not specify whether the person in the car was innocent or not, but it does not contradict the idea either.
   - The Hypothesis adds the detail that the person driving the car was innocent, which is additional information not present in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis introduces new information (the innocence of the driver) that is not explicitly stated in the Premise but does not contradict it, the relationship is Neutral.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1

(AMR)",2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation:

1. **Premise**: ""People who SPILLED over from the 'protest' attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.""
   - This statement indicates that people who were part of the protest became aggressive and attacked a car.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""People who spilled over from the 'protest' quietly watched their car as it went down Regent Street.""
   - This statement suggests that the same group of people observed the car pass by without any aggressive action.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an aggressive action (attacked their car).
   - The Hypothesis describes a passive action (quietly watched their car).

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are mutually exclusive. If the people attacked the car, they could not have been quietly watching it at the same time.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

**Relation Output**: 2",**Relation Output**: 2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"People who SPILLED over from the ""protest"" attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.","Their car was attacked by people who spilled over from the ""protest"" as it went down Regent Street.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""People who SPILLED over from the 'protest' attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.""
   - This sentence describes an event where people from a protest attacked a car on Regent Street.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Their car was attacked by people who spilled over from the 'protest' as it went down Regent Street.""
   - This sentence describes the same event, with a slight rephrasing of the Premise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: people from a protest attacking a car on Regent Street.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrased version of the Premise with no additional information or contradictions.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (it is a rephrased version of the same event), the relation is **Entailment**.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.",Marchers will proceed on Market until they reach the capital building.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that marchers will proceed on Pine St. to Broadway, and then to Market.
   - This implies a specific route: Pine St. → Broadway → Market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that marchers will proceed on Market until they reach the capital building.
   - This implies that the marchers will be on Market St. and continue until they reach a specific destination (the capital building).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not mention the final destination of the marchers, only the streets they will proceed through.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new piece of information (the capital building) and focuses on the marchers proceeding on Market St.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise because it is possible that after proceeding on Pine St. to Broadway, and then to Market, the marchers could continue on Market until they reach the capital building.
   - However, the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm that the marchers will indeed proceed to the capital building. It only specifies the streets they will take up to Market.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1 – Neutral

So, the final output is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.",Marchers will stop at Pine St and not continue to Broadway nor Market.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that ""Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.""
   - This indicates a sequence of movement: starting on Pine St., then moving to Broadway, and finally to Market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that ""Marchers will stop at Pine St and not continue to Broadway nor Market.""
   - This suggests that the marchers will halt their movement at Pine St. and will not proceed to the subsequent locations mentioned in the premise (Broadway and Market).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates a continuous movement through multiple streets.
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that the marchers will stop at Pine St. and not continue further.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the hypothesis states the opposite of what the premise indicates (i.e., stopping at Pine St. vs. proceeding to Broadway and Market), the hypothesis cannot be true if the premise is true.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final output:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.","From Pine St., to Broadway, then to Market marchers will continue.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""From Pine St., to Broadway, then to Market marchers will continue.""

- **Content Analysis**:
  - The Premise states that marchers will proceed on Pine St. to Broadway, and then to Market.
  - The Hypothesis rephrases this by stating that marchers will continue from Pine St., to Broadway, and then to Market.

- **Semantic Analysis**:
  - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of streets (Pine St., Broadway, Market) and the action of proceeding or continuing along these streets.
  - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise. It simply rephrases the same information.

- **Inference Relation**:
  - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and does not add or contradict any information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to march around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis.
   - The event is scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 24th.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Mine workers and supporters are protesting for fair wages at Peabody Energy in St. Louis.
   - The event is also scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 24th.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the same group of people (mine workers and supporters).
   - Both mention the same location (Peabody Energy headquarters in St. Louis).
   - Both mention the same date (Tuesday, Sept. 24th).
   - The Premise states that they plan to march, while the Hypothesis states that they are protesting for fair wages.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not specify the reason for the march, only that it is planned.
   - The Hypothesis adds additional information about the purpose of the march (protesting for fair wages).
   - Since the Premise does not provide information about the purpose of the march, we cannot definitively conclude that the Hypothesis is true or false based on the Premise alone.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral** because the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

**Final Relation Output**: 1",**Final Relation Output**: 1,False,True,False,1

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that ""Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to MARCH around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.""
   - This indicates a planned event involving a large number of people marching around a specific location on a specific date.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that ""No mine workers or supporters plan to march around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.""
   - This directly contradicts the premise by stating that no such plans exist.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise asserts the existence of a plan for thousands of people to march.
   - The hypothesis asserts the non-existence of any such plan.

4. **Inference Relation**:

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:
- Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the same event: a planned march by thousands of mine workers and supporters around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis on Tuesday, Sept. 24th.
- The information in the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the information in the Premise. There is no additional information or contradiction.
- The Hypothesis does not introduce any new elements that are not present in the Premise.
- The Hypothesis does not negate or contradict any part of the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

**Relation Output**: 0",**Relation Output**: 0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,"He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet , when a coil of gold , the color of the moonlight , FLASHED across the sand .","The man had vistied a totally different planet covered in sand that had looked like the wrong one, when a light flashed across the sand.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, FLASHED across the sand.""

### Hypothesis:
""The man had visited a totally different planet covered in sand that had looked like the wrong one, when a light flashed across the sand.""

### Analysis:
1. **Subject and Context**:
   - **Premise**: A man is on a planet and is afraid he might be on the wrong one. A coil of gold, resembling moonlight, flashes across the sand.
   - **Hypothesis**: A man is on a different planet covered in sand, which he thought was the wrong one, and a light flashes across the sand.

2. **Key Elements**:
   - **Premise**: 
     - The man is afraid he is on the wrong planet.
     - A coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashes across the sand.
   - **Hypothesis**:
     - The man is on a different planet covered in sand.
     - He thought it was the wrong planet.
     - A light flashes across the sand.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The **Premise** does not explicitly state that the planet is different or covered in sand, only that the man is afraid he might be on the wrong planet.
   - The **Hypothesis** introduces the idea that the planet is different and covered in sand, which is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.
   - Both mention something flashing across the sand, but the Premise specifies it as a ""coil of gold, the color of the moonlight,"" while the Hypothesis generalizes it as ""a light.""

### Conclusion:
- The Hypothesis introduces additional details (different planet, covered in sand) that are not confirmed or denied by the Premise.
- The flashing light detail is somewhat consistent but not exactly the same as the ""coil of gold"" in the Premise.
- Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

### Final Decision:
The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

**Relation Output**: 1",**Relation Output**: 1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,"He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet , when a coil of gold , the color of the moonlight , FLASHED across the sand .","He was not afraid that he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, FLASHED across the sand.""
   - This sentence indicates that the subject was starting to feel fear about being on the wrong planet, but then something (a coil of gold) flashed across the sand.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He was not afraid that he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand.""
   - This sentence states the opposite of the Premise regarding the subject's fear. It claims that the subject was not afraid of being on the wrong planet when the coil of gold flashed across the sand.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the subject was beginning to be afraid.
   - The Hypothesis states that the subject was not afraid.
   - These two statements are directly contradictory regarding the subject's emotional state.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because they express opposite emotions about the same situation.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet , when a coil of gold , the color of the moonlight , FLASHED across the sand .","A coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand as he was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, FLASHED across the sand.""
   - This sentence describes a situation where someone is feeling afraid of being on the wrong planet, and then sees a coil of gold, colored like moonlight, flashing across the sand.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""A coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand as he was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet.""
   - This sentence describes the same situation but rephrased. It mentions the coil of gold flashing across the sand and the person's fear of being on the wrong planet.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same events: the person's fear of being on the wrong planet and the sighting of a coil of gold flashing across the sand.
   - The order of the events is slightly different, but the meaning remains the same.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the same information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I RAN around the track.,I run professionally.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I RAN around the track.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker performed the action of running around a track at some point in the past.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I run professionally.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker runs as a profession, implying regular and professional engagement in running activities.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise describes a single instance of running around a track.
   - The Hypothesis describes a habitual or professional activity of running.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise would need to indicate that the speaker runs professionally. However, the Premise only indicates a single instance of running, not a professional engagement.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Premise does not provide enough information to determine whether the speaker runs professionally or not. The Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information given in the Premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: There is no direct contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis. The Premise does not negate the possibility of the speaker running professionally.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,I RAN around the track.,I walked around the track.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""I RAN around the track.""
   - This statement indicates that the person performed the action of running around the track.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""I walked around the track.""
   - This statement indicates that the person performed the action of walking around the track.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Running and walking are two different actions. Running generally implies a faster pace than walking.
   - If someone ran around the track, it does not imply that they also walked around the track. In fact, it suggests the opposite, as running and walking are mutually exclusive in this context.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - Since the Hypothesis (""I walked around the track"") cannot be true if the Premise (""I RAN around the track"") is true, the relationship between the two statements is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,I RAN around the track.,I circled the track by running.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I RAN around the track.""
   - This means the speaker performed the action of running and did so around a track.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I circled the track by running.""
   - This means the speaker performed the action of running and did so in a manner that involved circling the track.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action (running) and the same location (the track).
   - The Hypothesis specifies that the running involved circling the track, which is a reasonable interpretation of running around the track.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because running around the track inherently involves circling it.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DROVE through the tunnel.,I was driving in my car,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I DROVE through the tunnel.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker was driving and went through a tunnel.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I was driving in my car.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker was driving a car.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that the speaker drove through a tunnel, which implies that the speaker was driving.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker was driving in a car. Driving through a tunnel typically involves being in a vehicle, most commonly a car.
   - There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the Hypothesis. In fact, the act of driving through a tunnel strongly suggests that the speaker was in a car.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

**Conclusion**: The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is Entailment.

**Relation Output**: 0",**Relation Output**: 0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DROVE through the tunnel.,I avoided the tunnel.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I DROVE through the tunnel.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker traveled through the tunnel by driving.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I avoided the tunnel.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker did not go through the tunnel; instead, they chose to bypass it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker drove through the tunnel.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker avoided the tunnel.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If the speaker drove through the tunnel, it is impossible for them to have avoided it at the same time. These two actions are mutually exclusive.

Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

The correct relation is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DROVE through the tunnel.,I went throught the tunnel by driving.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I DROVE through the tunnel.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""I went through the tunnel by driving.""

- **Step 1: Check for Entailment (0)**
  - The Premise states that the person drove through the tunnel.
  - The Hypothesis states that the person went through the tunnel by driving.
  - Both statements convey the same action and method of traversal (driving through the tunnel).
  - Therefore, if the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must also be true.

- **Step 2: Check for Contradiction (2)**
  - There is no information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise. Both statements are consistent with each other.

- **Step 3: Check for Neutral (1)**
  - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, it cannot be neutral.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relation is:

**Relation Output**: 0",**Relation Output**: 0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,We DROVE past the hotel.,We DROVE all the way to the next city.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""We DROVE past the hotel.""
   - This statement indicates that the driving action involved passing by a specific location, the hotel.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""We DROVE all the way to the next city.""
   - This statement suggests that the driving action continued until reaching a different location, the next city.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not specify the final destination of the drive; it only mentions passing by the hotel.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new piece of information, stating that the drive continued to the next city.

4. **Inference Analysis**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the drive continued to the next city. However, the Premise only mentions passing the hotel, not the final destination.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise. The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, but it also does not provide enough information to confirm it. It is possible that after passing the hotel, the drive continued to the next city, but this is not certain from the given information.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly opposes the idea of driving to the next city. Since the Premise does not specify the final destination, it does not contradict the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,We DROVE past the hotel.,We drove straight to the hotel.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""We DROVE past the hotel.""
   - This indicates that the action of driving occurred and the hotel was passed by, implying that the destination was not the hotel itself.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""We drove straight to the hotel.""
   - This suggests that the destination of the driving was the hotel, implying a direct route to the hotel.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the hotel was passed by, meaning the hotel was not the final destination.
   - The Hypothesis states that the hotel was the final destination.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise because if you drive past the hotel, you are not driving straight to it. Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,We DROVE past the hotel.,We were driving when we went past the hotel.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""We DROVE past the hotel.""
   - This statement indicates that the action of driving past the hotel has already occurred.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""We were driving when we went past the hotel.""
   - This statement suggests that the action of driving was happening at the time they went past the hotel.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the action of driving past the hotel has occurred.
   - The Hypothesis states that they were driving when they went past the hotel, which is consistent with the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because if they drove past the hotel, it implies they were driving at that time.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.,The plane flew to its destination of California.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.""
   - This statement tells us that the plane's flight path included flying over the Grand Canyon. It does not provide any information about the plane's final destination.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The plane flew to its destination of California.""
   - This statement suggests that the plane's final destination was California. It does not specify any intermediate points or landmarks the plane flew over.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis are related to the plane's flight, but they provide different pieces of information. The Premise talks about the plane flying over a specific landmark (the Grand Canyon), while the Hypothesis talks about the plane's final destination (California).
   - The Premise does not confirm or deny the final destination of the plane. It is possible that the plane flew over the Grand Canyon and then continued to California, but this is not explicitly stated in the Premise.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. There is no direct contradiction, nor is there a definite entailment.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.,The plane didn't pass over the Grand Canyon.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.
Hypothesis: The plane didn't pass over the Grand Canyon.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The statement ""The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon"" indicates that the plane traveled above the Grand Canyon.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The statement ""The plane didn't pass over the Grand Canyon"" suggests that the plane did not travel above the Grand Canyon.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise states that the plane did fly over the Grand Canyon.
   - The Hypothesis states that the plane did not fly over the Grand Canyon.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the Premise is true (the plane flew over the Grand Canyon), then the Hypothesis (the plane didn't pass over the Grand Canyon) cannot be true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.,The plane was flying when it went over the Grand Canyon.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.""
   - This statement indicates that a plane was in flight and its path took it over the Grand Canyon.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The plane was flying when it went over the Grand Canyon.""
   - This statement suggests that the plane was in the act of flying as it passed over the Grand Canyon.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the plane flew over the Grand Canyon.
   - The Hypothesis states that the plane was flying when it went over the Grand Canyon.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. Both statements convey the same event: a plane in flight passing over the Grand Canyon.

Given that the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the information provided in the Premise, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .,I pass by Watkins Landing on my way into work and back home.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This indicates that the speaker drives past Watkins Landing twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I pass by Watkins Landing on my way into work and back home.""
   - This suggests that the speaker passes by Watkins Landing on their way to work and on their way back home.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action of passing by Watkins Landing twice a day.
   - The Premise specifies the times as ""morning and evening,"" while the Hypothesis specifies the purpose as ""on my way into work and back home.""
   - The times ""morning and evening"" can reasonably correspond to ""on my way into work and back home.""

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because the actions described are essentially the same, just phrased differently.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .,I avoid going past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker drives past Watkins Landing twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I avoid going past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker avoids going past Watkins Landing at the same times mentioned in the premise, i.e., every morning and evening.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker drives past Watkins Landing.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker avoids going past Watkins Landing.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are directly contradictory. If the speaker drives past Watkins Landing, they cannot simultaneously be avoiding it.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .,My driving route goes past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker drives past a specific location, Watkins Landing, twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""My driving route goes past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker's driving route includes passing by Watkins Landing twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same information: the speaker drives past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise without adding or contradicting any information.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship between the two is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail .,I commute by bike to stay healthy and enjoy the views from the Huguenot Trail.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail.""
   - This indicates that the speaker regularly travels to and from work using the Huguenot Trail.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I commute by bike to stay healthy and enjoy the views from the Huguenot Trail.""
   - This suggests that the speaker commutes by bike, with the additional motivations of staying healthy and enjoying the views.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not specify the mode of commuting (e.g., bike, car, walking).
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional details (commuting by bike, staying healthy, enjoying views) that are not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would need to be definitely true given the Premise. However, the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm that the speaker commutes by bike or for the reasons stated in the Hypothesis.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, but it also does not provide enough information to confirm it.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would need to be definitely false given the Premise. There is no information in the Premise that directly contradicts the Hypothesis.

Given that the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the details in the Hypothesis, the most appropriate relation is Neutral.

**Final Decision**:
1

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail .,I go around the Hugenot Trail as I go back and forth to work.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker regularly travels to and from work using the Huguenot Trail.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I go around the Hugenot Trail as I go back and forth to work.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker avoids the Huguenot Trail while commuting to and from work.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker uses the Huguenot Trail for commuting.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker avoids the Huguenot Trail for commuting.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the speaker commutes on the Huguenot Trail, it cannot be true that they go around it.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail .,I take the Hugenot Trail back and forth to work.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail.""
Hypothesis: ""I take the Hugenot Trail back and forth to work.""

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker commutes back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker takes the Huguenot Trail back and forth to work.

2. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same information: the speaker uses the Huguenot Trail for commuting to work.
   - The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is identical.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they express the same fact), the relation is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0

### Premise:
""Dade County and federal authorities, learning that he intended to FLY through Miami, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.""

### Hypothesis:
""Dade County and federal authorities, who are famous for daring arrests, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.""

### Analysis:
1. **Common Information**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that Dade County and federal authorities made plans to arrest him on gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.
   
2. **Additional Information in Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis adds the detail that Dade County and federal authorities are ""famous for daring arrests.""

3. **Consistency Check**:
   - The additional information in the Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise. It provides extra context about the authorities but does not change the core event described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis adds information that is not present in the Premise but does not contradict it, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The additional detail about the authorities being famous for daring arrests is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.

### Conclusion:
The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

### Final Output:

intransitive-motion,schematic,"Dade County and federal authorities, learning that he intended to FLY through Miami, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.","Dade County and federal authorities, didn't know that he intended to FLY through Miami, so they didn't make plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Dade County and federal authorities, learning that he intended to FLY through Miami, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.""
   - This means that the authorities were aware of his intention to fly through Miami and had made plans to arrest him upon his arrival.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Dade County and federal authorities, didn't know that he intended to FLY through Miami, so they didn't make plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.""
   - This means that the authorities were not aware of his intention to fly through Miami and therefore did not make any plans to arrest him.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the authorities knew about his intention and made plans to arrest him.
   - The Hypothesis states the opposite: the authorities did not know about his intention and did not make plans to arrest him.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise. The Premise asserts knowledge and planning by the authorities, while the Hypothesis asserts ignorance and lack of planning.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

Premise: ""Dade County and federal authorities, learning that he intended to FLY through Miami, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.""

Hypothesis: ""Dade County and federal authorities made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he touched U.S. soil once they learned he intended to fly into Miami.""

1. **Content Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that Dade County and federal authorities made plans to arrest him on gun-running charges.
   - Both state that the authorities learned about his intention to fly through/into Miami.
   - Both indicate that the arrest plans were to be executed as soon as he hit/touched U.S. soil.

2. **Paraphrasing**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a paraphrase of the Premise. The key elements (authorities, plans to arrest, gun-running charges, learning about his intention to fly, and arrest upon hitting U.S. soil) are all present in both statements.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - There is no new information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any uncertainty or additional conditions that would make it only possibly true (neutral).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the Hypothesis restates the information in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

   - These small fires are identified as heroin labs.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that major opium-producing areas that house heroin labs can be spotted by looking for small fires from high above.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates that small fires in the mountains are visible when flying over major opium-producing areas and that these fires are heroin labs.
   - The hypothesis essentially rephrases this information, stating that these areas can be identified by looking for small fires from above.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis is a restatement of the information provided in the premise.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the hypothesis.
   - The hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

2. **Additional Information**:
   - The Premise states that these birds ""choose to roost for winter here.""
   - The Hypothesis adds that these birds ""have inspired beautiful art for generations.""

3. **Consistency Check**:
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information about the birds inspiring beautiful art, which is not mentioned in the Premise.
   - However, this new information does not contradict the Premise. It is additional information that could be true but is not necessarily implied by the Premise.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The additional information about inspiring art is not entailed by the Premise but is also not contradictory.

### Final Decision:
The relation is **Neutral**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Each year, over 50,000 migratory birds FLY over Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here.""
   - This statement indicates that a significant number of migratory birds fly over the skyscrapers in Hong Kong and decide to stay there for the winter.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Each year, over 50,000 migratory birds go around Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose to not roost for winter here.""
   - This statement suggests that the birds avoid flying over the skyscrapers and do not stay in Hong Kong for the winter.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the birds fly over the skyscrapers and roost in Hong Kong for the winter.
   - The Hypothesis states the opposite: the birds go around the skyscrapers and do not roost in Hong Kong for the winter.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The actions of the birds described in the Hypothesis are the opposite of those described in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,But it's all FLYING right over your head.,They are not understanding the point.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""But it's all FLYING right over your head.""
   - Interpretation: This phrase is an idiom meaning that someone is not understanding or grasping the point being made.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""They are not understanding the point.""
   - Interpretation: This statement directly states that someone is not understanding the point.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise uses an idiom to convey that someone is not understanding the point.
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states that someone is not understanding the point.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a direct and explicit restatement of the idiomatic meaning of the Premise.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,But it's all FLYING right over your head.,But it's all sticking in your head.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""But it's all FLYING right over your head.""
   - This suggests that the information or situation is not being understood or noticed by the person being addressed.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""But it's all sticking in your head.""
   - This suggests that the information or situation is being understood or remembered by the person being addressed.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a lack of understanding or awareness.
   - The Hypothesis indicates the opposite, that there is understanding or awareness.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise and Hypothesis present opposite situations (one indicating lack of understanding and the other indicating understanding), they cannot both be true simultaneously.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,But it's all FLYING right over your head.,But it's all going right over your head.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""But it's all FLYING right over your head.""
Hypothesis: ""But it's all going right over your head.""

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The key phrase in the Premise is ""FLYING right over your head.""
   - The key phrase in the Hypothesis is ""going right over your head.""

2. **Comparison**:
   - The word ""FLYING"" in the Premise is replaced by ""going"" in the Hypothesis.
   - Both phrases convey the same meaning: something is not being understood or noticed by the person.

3. **Contextual Understanding**:
   - The context of both the Premise and the Hypothesis is about something being missed or not comprehended by the person.
   - The change from ""FLYING"" to ""going"" does not alter the overall meaning.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis maintains the same meaning as the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,"It will be like you're FLOATING along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.",Quitting smoking may imrove your ability to swim and complete other cardiovascular exercises.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""It will be like you're FLOATING along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.""
   - This sentence describes a scenario where someone feels fine but suddenly gets a strong urge to smoke.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Quitting smoking may improve your ability to swim and complete other cardiovascular exercises.""
   - This sentence suggests that quitting smoking can have positive effects on one's ability to perform physical activities like swimming and other cardiovascular exercises.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about the experience of suddenly feeling an urge to smoke.
   - The Hypothesis talks about the potential benefits of quitting smoking on physical fitness.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the benefits of quitting smoking or its impact on physical fitness.
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information that is not addressed in the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis introduces new information that is not directly related to the Premise and cannot be inferred from it, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,"It will be like you're FLOATING along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.","It will be like you're stopped, unable to move, then finally you are freed by the urge to smoke.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""It will be like you're FLOATING along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.""
   - This suggests a scenario where someone is moving along smoothly (floating) and then suddenly experiences a strong urge to smoke.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""It will be like you're stopped, unable to move, then finally you are freed by the urge to smoke.""
   - This suggests a scenario where someone is initially unable to move (stopped) and then experiences an urge to smoke that frees them.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a transition from a smooth state (floating) to a sudden urge to smoke.
   - The Hypothesis describes a transition from an immobile state (stopped) to being freed by the urge to smoke.
   - The two scenarios are fundamentally different: the Premise describes a smooth state interrupted by an urge, while the Hypothesis describes an immobile state resolved by an urge.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise because the states described (floating vs. stopped) and the effects of the urge to smoke (caught up vs. freed) are contradictory.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"It will be like you're FLOATING along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.",In an instant you will be caught up in this huge urge to smoke after feeling like you're floating along fine.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""It will be like you're FLOATING along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.""
   - This sentence describes a situation where a person feels fine (floating along) and then suddenly experiences a strong urge to smoke.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""In an instant you will be caught up in this huge urge to smoke after feeling like you're floating along fine.""
   - This sentence describes the same situation where a person feels fine and then suddenly experiences a strong urge to smoke.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of events: feeling fine (floating along) followed by a sudden strong urge to smoke.
   - The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is identical.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they describe the same situation), the relation is **Entailment**.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.,Laws change all the time throughout the years.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.""
   - This suggests that the law is expected to change frequently in the future.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Laws change all the time throughout the years.""
   - This suggests that laws are constantly changing over time.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a probable frequent change in the law in the future.
   - The Hypothesis states that laws are always changing over time, which is a more general statement about the nature of laws.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not definitively confirm or deny the general statement in the Hypothesis. It suggests a specific future scenario that aligns with the general nature of the Hypothesis but does not provide conclusive evidence for it.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.,The law will probably stay the same in the coming years.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.
Hypothesis: The law will probably stay the same in the coming years.

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The Premise suggests that the law is expected to change frequently (""JUMP back and forth"") in the coming years.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis suggests that the law is expected to remain unchanged (""stay the same"") in the coming years.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise indicates frequent changes in the law.
   - The Hypothesis indicates no changes in the law.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis present opposite expectations about the law's behavior in the coming years.
   - If the law is expected to change frequently, it cannot simultaneously be expected to stay the same.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.,In the coming years the law will most likely jump back and forth.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""In the coming years the law will most likely jump back and forth.""

- **Content Analysis**:
  - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis discuss the law's behavior in the coming years.
  - The Premise uses the phrase ""will probably JUMP back and forth,"" indicating a high likelihood but not certainty.
  - The Hypothesis uses the phrase ""will most likely jump back and forth,"" which also indicates a high likelihood but not certainty.

- **Paraphrasing**:
  - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with synonymous terms (""probably"" and ""most likely"").

- **Logical Consistency**:
  - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
  - The Hypothesis does not leave room for doubt about the Premise's statement.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and maintains the same meaning, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.,The 23 are scared the sub is sinking.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.""
   - This suggests that 23 individuals are moving quickly and with urgency to the back of a submarine.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The 23 are scared the sub is sinking.""
   - This suggests that the 23 individuals are frightened because they believe the submarine is sinking.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a frantic movement to the rear of the submarine, which implies a sense of urgency or panic.
   - The Hypothesis provides a possible reason for this behavior, suggesting that the individuals are scared because they think the submarine is sinking.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state the reason for the frantic scrambling, but the Hypothesis offers a plausible explanation.
   - The Hypothesis is not definitively true based on the Premise alone, as there could be other reasons for the frantic movement (e.g., an emergency drill, a fire, etc.).
   - However, the Hypothesis is also not contradicted by the Premise; it is a reasonable interpretation of the situation described.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as **Neutral**.

Therefore, the appropriate numerical value is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.,The 23 were calm at the rear of the sub.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.""
   - This indicates that 23 individuals were moving quickly and in a panicked manner towards the rear of the submarine.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The 23 were calm at the rear of the sub.""
   - This suggests that the same 23 individuals were in a state of calmness at the rear of the submarine.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a frantic and hurried movement, implying a state of panic or urgency.
   - The Hypothesis describes a state of calmness, which is directly opposite to the state described in the Premise.

4. **Inference**:
   - Since the Premise indicates a frantic and panicked state, and the Hypothesis indicates a calm state, the two statements are contradictory.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.,The rear of the sub had 23 frantically scrambling towards it.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.""
   - This sentence indicates that a group of 23 individuals were moving quickly and in a disorganized manner towards the rear of the submarine.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The rear of the sub had 23 frantically scrambling towards it.""
   - This sentence suggests that the rear of the submarine was the destination for 23 individuals who were moving quickly and in a disorganized manner.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: 23 individuals moving frantically towards the rear of the submarine.
   - The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is identical.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they describe the same situation), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0

### Premise:
""IRNA reported that Gomshadzehi killed a policeman and then ESCAPED to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates while trafficking drugs in 2003.""

### Hypothesis:
""There is a criminal named Gomshadzehi who did not care about the lives of others or himself when he carried out his crimes in 2003.""

### Analysis:
1. **Content Matching**:
   - The Premise provides specific details about Gomshadzehi's actions: killing a policeman, escaping to Dubai, and trafficking drugs in 2003.
   - The Hypothesis makes a general statement about Gomshadzehi's disregard for lives (both others and his own) during his crimes in 2003.

2. **Information Overlap**:
   - The Hypothesis does not directly contradict the Premise. It is plausible that someone who killed a policeman and trafficked drugs might be considered as not caring about the lives of others or himself.
   - However, the Hypothesis introduces a subjective interpretation (""did not care about the lives of others or himself"") that is not explicitly stated in the Premise.

3. **Inference Type**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would need to be a direct and definite consequence of the Premise. The Premise does not explicitly state that Gomshadzehi did not care about lives.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis is a plausible interpretation of the Premise but is not definitively supported or contradicted by it.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would need to be directly opposed to the information in the Premise. This is not the case here.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis is a plausible interpretation of the Premise but is not definitively supported or contradicted by it. Therefore, the relationship is Neutral.

### Final Answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1

   - **Event**: Gomshadzehi killed a policeman.
   - **Action**: Escaped to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
   - **Context**: While trafficking drugs in 2003.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - **Event**: Gomshadzehi helped a policeman.
   - **Action**: Was captive in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
   - **Context**: While trafficking drugs in 2003.

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Event**: The Premise states that Gomshadzehi killed a policeman, while the Hypothesis states that Gomshadzehi helped a policeman. These two actions are directly contradictory.
   - **Action**: The Premise states that Gomshadzehi escaped to Dubai, while the Hypothesis states that Gomshadzehi was captive in Dubai. These two states are also directly contradictory.
   - **Context**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree on the context of trafficking drugs in 2003, but this does not mitigate the contradictions in the events and actions.

Given these contradictions in both the event and the action, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

**Conclusion**: The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

**Relation Output**: 2",**Relation Output**: 2,False,False,True,2

   - Context: While trafficking drugs in 2003

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Source: It was reported by IRNA
   - Subject: Gomshadzehi
   - Actions: Escaped to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates after killing a policeman
   - Context: While trafficking drugs in 2003

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the same source (IRNA).
   - Both mention the same subject (Gomshadzehi).
   - Both describe the same actions (killing a policeman and escaping to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates).
   - Both provide the same context (while trafficking drugs in 2003).

4. **Order and Details**:
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but maintains the same sequence of events and details.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction in the Hypothesis compared to the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise with no additional or contradictory information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,Armed troops MARCHED to the substations and turned the power back on.,Armed troops MARCHED to the substations that powered over half of the city.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Armed troops MARCHED to the substations and turned the power back on.""
   - This statement tells us that armed troops went to the substations and restored power.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Armed troops MARCHED to the substations that powered over half of the city.""
   - This statement tells us that the substations the troops marched to were responsible for powering over half of the city.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not specify how much of the city the substations powered. It only mentions that the troops marched to the substations and turned the power back on.
   - The Hypothesis adds additional information about the substations powering over half of the city, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide information about the extent of the power coverage of the substations, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the given Premise. There is no direct contradiction, nor is there a definite confirmation.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

intransitive-motion,schematic,Armed troops MARCHED to the substations and turned the power back on.,Armed troops left the substations and turned the power off.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Armed troops MARCHED to the substations and turned the power back on.""
   - This indicates that armed troops moved to the substations and restored the power.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Armed troops left the substations and turned the power off.""
   - This suggests that armed troops departed from the substations and cut off the power.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the troops went to the substations and turned the power on.
   - The Hypothesis states that the troops left the substations and turned the power off.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict the actions described in the Premise.
   - The Premise and Hypothesis cannot both be true simultaneously because turning the power on is the opposite of turning the power off, and marching to the substations is the opposite of leaving them.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

1. **Premise**: ""Armed troops MARCHED to the substations and turned the power back on.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""The power was turned back on by armed troops that marched to the substations.""

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:
- The Premise states that armed troops marched to the substations and turned the power back on.
- The Hypothesis states that the power was turned back on by armed troops that marched to the substations.

**Comparison**:
- Both statements describe the same event: armed troops marching to the substations and turning the power back on.
- The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise, maintaining the same meaning and sequence of events.

**Conclusion**:
- Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship between the two is one of **Entailment**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

### Premise:
""The Vietnam News Agency said Australian national Tran Van Thanh was arrested on 30 June 2003 in the southern Vietnam city of Dalat for Tran's involvement in a network SMUGGLING heroin from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam.""

### Hypothesis:
""The Vietnam News Agency, which has earned several prizes for journalism, said Australian national Tran Van Thanh was arrested on 30 June 2003 in the southern Vietnam city of Dalat for Tran's involvement in a network SMUGGLING heroin.""

### Analysis:
1. **Common Information**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that the Vietnam News Agency reported the arrest of Tran Van Thanh on 30 June 2003 in Dalat.
   - Both state that Tran Van Thanh was involved in a network smuggling heroin.

2. **Additional Information in the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis adds that the Vietnam News Agency has earned several prizes for journalism. This information is not present in the Premise.

3. **Missing Information in the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis does not mention the specific route of the smuggling network (from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam) that is detailed in the Premise.

### Conclusion:
- The additional information about the Vietnam News Agency's prizes for journalism does not contradict the Premise.
- The omission of the specific smuggling route in the Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise either; it simply leaves out some details.

Given that the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise (since it omits some details but does not contradict any information), the relationship is best described as **Neutral**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Vietnam News Agency reported that Tran Van Thanh, an Australian national, was arrested on 30 June 2003.
   - The arrest took place in Dalat, a city in southern Vietnam.
   - Tran Van Thanh was involved in a network smuggling heroin from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Vietnam News Agency reported that Tran Van Thanh, an Australian national, was arrested on 30 June 2003.
   - The arrest took place in Dalat, a city in southern Vietnam.
   - Tran Van Thanh was involved in a network hoarding and keeping heroin strictly in Cambodia.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree on the identity of the person (Tran Van Thanh), the date of arrest (30 June 2003), and the location of the arrest (Dalat, southern Vietnam).
   - The key difference lies in the nature of the network's activities:
     - **Premise**: The network was smuggling heroin from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam.
     - **Hypothesis**: The network was hoarding and keeping heroin strictly in Cambodia.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise states that the network was involved in smuggling heroin across multiple countries (Cambodia, Vietnam, and Australia).
   - The Hypothesis states that the network was only hoarding and keeping heroin within Cambodia, which directly contradicts the smuggling activity described in the Premise.

Given this contradiction in the activities described, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases but Indian officials suspect that poultry could be SMUGGLED through Myanmar from Thailand.""
   - Key points:
     - No reported H5N1 cases in Myanmar.
     - Indian officials suspect poultry smuggling through Myanmar from Thailand.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Poultry smuggling from Thailand is the main way that disease and crime spreads to Myanmar.""
   - Key points:
     - Poultry smuggling from Thailand is claimed to be the main way disease and crime spread to Myanmar.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions a suspicion of poultry smuggling but does not confirm it as the main way disease and crime spread to Myanmar.
   - The Hypothesis makes a definitive claim about poultry smuggling being the main way disease and crime spread to Myanmar, which is not supported or mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information (main way disease and crime spread) that is not supported by the Premise.
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Therefore, the relation is:

**Premise:** Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases but Indian officials suspect that poultry could be SMUGGLED through Myanmar from Thailand.

**Hypothesis:** Myanmar has reported H5N1 cases but Indian officials suspect that poultry could be removed from Myanmar to Thailand.

1. **Comparison of H5N1 cases:**
   - Premise: Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases.
   - Hypothesis: Myanmar has reported H5N1 cases.
   - This is a direct contradiction because the Premise states there are no reported cases, while the Hypothesis states there are reported cases.

2. **Comparison of poultry movement:**
   - Premise: Poultry could be smuggled through Myanmar from Thailand.
   - Hypothesis: Poultry could be removed from Myanmar to Thailand.
   - This is also a contradiction because the direction of the poultry movement is reversed in the Hypothesis compared to the Premise.

Given these two points of contradiction, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

**Conclusion:** The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

     - Seven hundred passengers were stranded for two hours.
     - They were guided through the tunnels to a safe place.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""After the seven hundred passengers on the train were stranded for two hours, they were determined to find another way to get to work.""
   - Key points:
     - Seven hundred passengers were stranded for two hours.
     - They were determined to find another way to get to work.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree on the fact that the passengers were stranded for two hours.
   - The Premise states that the passengers were guided through the tunnels to a safe place.
   - The Hypothesis states that the passengers were determined to find another way to get to work.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis provide different information about what happened after the passengers were stranded.
   - The Premise focuses on the immediate action taken (guiding the passengers to a safe place).
   - The Hypothesis focuses on the passengers' determination to find another way to get to work, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

Since the Hypothesis introduces new information that is not directly supported or contradicted by the Premise, it is uncertain whether the Hypothesis is true or false based on the Premise alone.

Therefore, the relation is **Neutral**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that if someone thinks that Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out, they should talk to a retiree.
   - Key points: ""kicked out the door"" implies being forced out or discharged, and the suggestion is to talk to a retiree to understand the reality.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that if someone thinks that Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they retire, they should check how many retirees live in Florida.
   - Key points: ""retire"" implies a voluntary end of service, and the suggestion is to check the number of retirees in Florida.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about being ""kicked out"" (involuntary discharge), while the Hypothesis talks about ""retire"" (voluntary end of service).
   - The actions suggested in both are different: talking to a retiree vs. checking the number of retirees in Florida.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis are discussing different scenarios (involuntary discharge vs. voluntary retirement) and different actions to take.
   - The Hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the Premise and introduces a different context.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they KICK you out the door talk to a retiree.""
   - This implies that if someone believes that the Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out, they should talk to a retiree.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they kick you out the door, don't bother talking to a retiree.""
   - This implies that if someone believes that the Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out, they should not talk to a retiree.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise suggests that talking to a retiree is a recommended action if someone believes the Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after being kicked out.
   - The hypothesis suggests the opposite action, i.e., not talking to a retiree if someone believes the Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after being kicked out.

4. **Inference Relation**:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.""
   - This means the speaker is expressing difficulty in understanding how a certain situation was permitted to occur.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""It is challenging for them to understand what is allowed to happen.""
   - This means that it is difficult for some people (referred to as ""them"") to comprehend what is permitted to occur.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis both express difficulty in understanding a situation.
   - The Premise uses ""I"" while the Hypothesis uses ""them,"" but the core idea of difficulty in understanding remains the same.
   - The Hypothesis generalizes the difficulty to ""them"" instead of ""I,"" but this does not change the fundamental meaning.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a generalization of the Premise. It does not contradict the Premise, nor does it provide additional information that would make it uncertain.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis can be considered true because it essentially restates the same idea in a slightly different form.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

   - Premise: ""I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.""
   - Meaning: The speaker is expressing confusion or inability to understand how a certain situation was allowed to occur.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""I can understand perfectly how this was allowed to happen.""
   - Meaning: The speaker is expressing clear understanding of how the situation was allowed to occur.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a lack of understanding (""I can't wrap my head around..."").
   - The Hypothesis indicates complete understanding (""I can understand perfectly..."").

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis are expressing opposite states of understanding.
   - If the Premise is true (the speaker cannot understand), then the Hypothesis (the speaker can understand perfectly) cannot be true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis contain the same content. They express the same idea that the speaker is unable to understand how a certain event was allowed to happen.

2. **Paraphrasing**:
   - The Hypothesis is a paraphrased version of the Premise. The structure of the sentence is changed, but the meaning remains identical.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is just a rephrased version of the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.""
   - This indicates a specific action where the MiG-25 (a type of aircraft) fired an Air-to-Air Missile (AAM) at the Predator (likely another aircraft or drone).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The MiG-25 is well-equipped compared to the Predator.""
   - This is a general statement about the relative equipment or capabilities of the MiG-25 compared to the Predator.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides a specific event (firing a missile), while the Hypothesis makes a general claim about equipment and capabilities.
   - The action of firing a missile does not directly confirm or deny the overall equipment status of the MiG-25 compared to the Predator. It suggests that the MiG-25 has at least one type of weapon (an AAM), but it does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the MiG-25 is overall better equipped.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the general claim made in the Hypothesis, the relationship is not one of entailment or contradiction.
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the appropriate relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.""
   - This means that the MiG-25 launched an air-to-air missile (AAM) targeting the Predator.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The MiG-25 ceased fire at the Predator.""
   - This means that the MiG-25 stopped firing at the Predator.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates an active action of firing a missile.
   - The Hypothesis indicates the cessation of firing, which directly contradicts the action described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis states the opposite of what the Premise describes (firing vs. ceasing fire), the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

1. **Premise**: ""Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.""
   - This statement tells us that the Pope was transported by air to a specific U.S. military base located in Ramstein, Germany.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base in Germany, where he stayed for weeks.""
   - This statement also indicates that the Pope was transported by air to a U.S. military base in Germany. However, it adds additional information that the Pope stayed there for weeks.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The core information in both the Premise and the Hypothesis is that the Pope was flown to a U.S. military base in Germany.
   - The Hypothesis adds the detail that the Pope stayed there for weeks, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The additional detail in the Hypothesis (that the Pope stayed for weeks) is not contradicted by the Premise, but it is also not confirmed by it.

caused-motion,schematic,"Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.","Pope didn't fly to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.""
   - This statement indicates that the Pope was transported by air to a specific location, which is the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Pope didn't fly to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.""
   - This statement asserts that the Pope did not fly to the specified location.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the Pope was flown to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that the Pope did not fly to that location.

Given this direct contradiction, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

- **Contradiction**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the appropriate numerical value for the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
caused-motion,schematic,"Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.","It was the military base at Ramstein, Germany that Pope was flown to.",0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

Premise: ""Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.""
Hypothesis: ""It was the military base at Ramstein, Germany that Pope was flown to.""

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - Subject: Pope
   - Action: was flown
   - Destination: U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - Subject: Pope
   - Action: was flown
   - Destination: military base at Ramstein, Germany

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the same subject (Pope).
   - Both mention the same action (was flown).
   - Both mention the same destination (military base at Ramstein, Germany).

4. **Check for any additional information or differences:**
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but does not add or contradict any information.
   - The Hypothesis maintains the same meaning as the Premise.

Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
caused-motion,schematic,Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali and jailed for 20 years.,"Schapelle Corby, who was Australian, got caught and was imprisoned for something illegal.",1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

Premise: ""Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali and jailed for 20 years.""

Hypothesis: ""Schapelle Corby, who was Australian, got caught and was imprisoned for something illegal.""

1. **Identify Key Information in the Premise:**
   - Schapelle Corby is Australian.
   - She was convicted of trafficking marijuana.
   - The trafficking was into Bali.
   - She was jailed for 20 years.

2. **Identify Key Information in the Hypothesis:**
   - Schapelle Corby is Australian.
   - She got caught.
   - She was imprisoned.
   - The reason for imprisonment was something illegal.

3. **Compare the Information:**
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis agree that Schapelle Corby is Australian.
   - Both agree that she was caught and imprisoned.
   - The Hypothesis states she was imprisoned for something illegal, which is consistent with the Premise stating she was convicted of trafficking marijuana (an illegal activity).

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict any information in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a generalization of the Premise, as it does not specify the exact illegal activity (trafficking marijuana) but states she was imprisoned for something illegal.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because trafficking marijuana is indeed an illegal activity.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

caused-motion,schematic,Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali and jailed for 20 years.,Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of removing marijuana from Bali and jailed for 20 years.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali and jailed for 20 years.""
   - Key information: Schapelle Corby was convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali and received a 20-year jail sentence.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of removing marijuana from Bali and jailed for 20 years.""
   - Key information: Schapelle Corby was convicted of removing marijuana from Bali and received a 20-year jail sentence.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Schapelle Corby was trafficking marijuana into Bali.
   - The Hypothesis states that Schapelle Corby was removing marijuana from Bali.

4. **Inference Analysis**:
   - The act of ""trafficking marijuana into Bali"" implies bringing marijuana into Bali.
   - The act of ""removing marijuana from Bali"" implies taking marijuana out of Bali.
   - These two actions are directly opposite in direction (into vs. from), which means they cannot both be true simultaneously.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
caused-motion,schematic,Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali and jailed for 20 years.,Australian Schapelle Corby was jailed for 20 years because he was convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

**Premise:** Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali and jailed for 20 years.

**Hypothesis:** Australian Schapelle Corby was jailed for 20 years because he was convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali.

1. **Subject Consistency:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis refer to ""Australian Schapelle Corby.""

2. **Action Consistency:**
   - The Premise states that Schapelle Corby was ""convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali and jailed for 20 years.""
   - The Hypothesis states that Schapelle Corby was ""jailed for 20 years because he was convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali.""

3. **Temporal Consistency:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the same sequence of events: conviction for trafficking marijuana into Bali followed by a 20-year jail sentence.

4. **Causal Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states the causal relationship implied in the Premise: the jail sentence is a result of the conviction for trafficking marijuana.

5. **Pronoun Consistency:**
   - There is a minor inconsistency in pronoun usage (""he"" in the Hypothesis instead of ""she""), but this does not affect the overall meaning or the logical relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis.

Given that the Hypothesis restates the information in the Premise with the same meaning and logical sequence, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

**Conclusion:**
The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

caused-motion,schematic,The Pakistan-born man was then DEPORTED to the United Kingdom on 070713.,The man from Pakistan went against his will to the United Kingdom for a crime committed.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The subject is ""The Pakistan-born man.""
   - The action is ""was then DEPORTED.""
   - The destination is ""to the United Kingdom.""
   - The date is ""on 070713.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The subject is ""The man from Pakistan.""
   - The action is ""went against his will.""
   - The destination is ""to the United Kingdom.""
   - The reason is ""for a crime committed.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree on the subject being a man from Pakistan.
   - Both agree on the destination being the United Kingdom.
   - The Premise states the man was ""DEPORTED,"" which implies being sent against his will.
   - The Hypothesis states the man ""went against his will,"" which aligns with the concept of deportation.
   - The Premise does not specify the reason for deportation, while the Hypothesis adds that it was ""for a crime committed.""

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information (the reason for deportation) that is not present in the Premise.
   - The additional information does not contradict the Premise but is not explicitly supported by it either.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
caused-motion,schematic,The Pakistan-born man was then DEPORTED to the United Kingdom on 070713.,The Pakistan-born man was then allowed to stay in the United Kingdom on 070713.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation:

1. **Premise**: ""The Pakistan-born man was then DEPORTED to the United Kingdom on 070713.""
   - This means that the man was sent out of a country and sent to the United Kingdom on the specified date.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The Pakistan-born man was then allowed to stay in the United Kingdom on 070713.""
   - This means that the man was permitted to remain in the United Kingdom on the specified date.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the man was deported to the United Kingdom, implying he was sent there from another country.
   - The Hypothesis states that the man was allowed to stay in the United Kingdom, which directly contradicts the idea of being deported (sent away).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since being deported to a country and being allowed to stay in that country are mutually exclusive events, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final output:

2",2,False,False,True,2

1. **Premise**: ""The Pakistan-born man was then DEPORTED to the United Kingdom on 070713.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""On 070713 the Pakistan-born man was then deported to the United Kingdom.""

- Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same information: a Pakistan-born man was deported to the United Kingdom on the date 070713.
- The order of the information is slightly different, but the meaning remains unchanged.
- There are no additional details or conflicting information between the Premise and the Hypothesis.

Given that the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the information provided in the Premise, the correct relation is:

0 – Entailment

Therefore, the output is:

caused-motion,schematic,The pilot refused to ALLOW the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.,The Pakistan-born man was a threat to the pilot on the pilot's plane.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation:

1. **Premise**: ""The pilot refused to ALLOW the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.""
   - This statement tells us that the pilot did not permit the Pakistan-born man to board the plane. It does not provide any specific reason for the refusal.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The Pakistan-born man was a threat to the pilot on the pilot's plane.""
   - This statement suggests that the reason the pilot refused to allow the Pakistan-born man onto the plane was that the man was perceived as a threat.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about why the pilot refused to allow the man onto the plane. It only states the action (refusal) without giving a reason.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a specific reason (the man being a threat) which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not confirm or deny the reason for the refusal, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information given in the Premise. There is no direct contradiction, but there is also no direct support for the Hypothesis.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
caused-motion,schematic,The pilot refused to ALLOW the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.,The pilot insisted on allowing the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The pilot refused to ALLOW the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.""
   - This statement indicates that the pilot did not permit the Pakistan-born man to board the plane.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The pilot insisted on allowing the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.""
   - This statement suggests that the pilot was determined to permit the Pakistan-born man to board the plane.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the pilot refused to allow the man onto the plane.
   - The Hypothesis states that the pilot insisted on allowing the man onto the plane.

4. **Inference**:
   - The two statements are directly contradictory. The Premise indicates a refusal, while the Hypothesis indicates insistence on allowing.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
caused-motion,schematic,The pilot refused to ALLOW the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.,The Pakistan-born man was refused by the pilot to be allowed onto the pilot's plane.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The pilot refused to ALLOW the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""The Pakistan-born man was refused by the pilot to be allowed onto the pilot's plane.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Subject**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis involve ""the pilot"" and ""the Pakistan-born man.""
- **Action**: The action in both sentences is the refusal by the pilot to allow the Pakistan-born man onto the plane.
- **Object**: The object in both sentences is the same, i.e., the pilot's plane.
- **Verb Tense and Structure**: The Premise uses active voice (""The pilot refused to ALLOW""), while the Hypothesis uses passive voice (""The Pakistan-born man was refused by the pilot"").

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise in passive voice but conveys the exact same information. Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""China confirmed on January 23, 2007 after 12 days of silence that China had FIRED a guided missile, JL-2 'Ju Lang' 2, into space.""

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:
- Both the Premise and the Hypothesis state that China confirmed on January 23, 2007, after 12 days of silence, that it had fired a guided missile into space.
- The Premise specifies that the missile was fired to destroy one of its satellites.
- The Hypothesis specifies the name of the missile, ""JL-2 'Ju Lang' 2,"" but does not mention the purpose of destroying a satellite.

**Key Points**:
- The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it adds additional information (the name of the missile).
- The Hypothesis does not confirm the purpose of the missile (destroying a satellite), but it does not deny it either.
- The additional information in the Hypothesis (the name of the missile) is not present in the Premise, making it uncertain whether the Hypothesis is definitely true or not based on the Premise alone.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as **Neutral** because the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

**Premise:** Chinese officials stated on May 14, 2007 that China had LAUNCHED a Chinese manufactured communications satellite into orbit on behalf of Nigeria.

**Hypothesis:** Chinese officials stated on May 14, 2007 that China had returned a Chinese manufactured communications satellite from orbit back to earth on behalf of Nigeria.

1. **Identify the key actions in the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Premise: ""LAUNCHED a Chinese manufactured communications satellite into orbit""
   - Hypothesis: ""returned a Chinese manufactured communications satellite from orbit back to earth""

2. **Compare the actions:**
   - The action in the Premise is ""launched into orbit,"" which means sending the satellite from Earth to space.
   - The action in the Hypothesis is ""returned from orbit back to earth,"" which means bringing the satellite from space back to Earth.

3. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are opposite. Launching into orbit and returning from orbit are contradictory actions.
   - Therefore, if the Premise is true (the satellite was launched into orbit), the Hypothesis (the satellite was returned from orbit) cannot be true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

   - Both specify that the launch was done by China.
   - Both mention the date May 14, 2007, and that Chinese officials made the statement.

2. **Paraphrasing**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a paraphrased version of the Premise. It rearranges the information but does not change the meaning.

3. **Checking for Contradiction**:
   - There is no information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.

4. **Checking for Neutrality**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that is not present in the Premise. It simply rephrases the same information.

5. **Checking for Entailment**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Kevin lifted the trumpet and filled the room with happy noise.""
   - This means Kevin played the trumpet, and the sound he produced filled the room.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Kevin lifted the trumpet and played to an audience that filled the room.""
   - This means Kevin played the trumpet, and there was an audience present that filled the room.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the room was filled with happy noise due to Kevin playing the trumpet.
   - The Hypothesis states that the room was filled with an audience while Kevin played the trumpet.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not mention anything about an audience; it only mentions the noise filling the room.
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information about an audience that is not present in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the presence of an audience.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Kevin lifted the trumpet and filled the room with happy noise.""
   - This indicates that Kevin played the trumpet, which resulted in the room being filled with happy noise.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Kevin lowered the trumpet and filled the room with silence.""
   - This suggests that Kevin stopped playing the trumpet, which resulted in the room being filled with silence.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Kevin played the trumpet and created noise.
   - The Hypothesis states that Kevin stopped playing the trumpet and created silence.
   - These two actions are directly opposite: playing the trumpet (creating noise) vs. stopping playing the trumpet (creating silence).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are contradictory (one cannot be true if the other is true), the relationship between the Premise and Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Kevin lifted the trumpet and filled the room with happy noise.,Kevin lifted the trumpet and made happy noise in the room.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

   - Kevin performed an action (lifting the trumpet).
   - As a result of this action, the room was filled with happy noise.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Kevin lifted the trumpet and made happy noise in the room.""
   - Kevin performed the same action (lifting the trumpet).
   - As a result of this action, happy noise was made in the room.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe Kevin lifting the trumpet.
   - Both statements indicate that happy noise was produced in the room as a result of Kevin lifting the trumpet.
   - The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is essentially the same.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and conveys the same information, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship is:

   - This statement indicates that a person (referred to as ""Dude"") has placed flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards in a room.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""A man filled the room with sweet things for his significant other.""
   - This statement suggests that a man has placed sweet things in a room for his significant other.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions specific items: flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards.
   - The Hypothesis generalizes these items as ""sweet things"" and adds the motivation ""for his significant other.""

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise explicitly stated that the items were for his significant other.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not specify the purpose or recipient of the items, so it is possible but not certain that they were for a significant other.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise explicitly stated that the items were not for a significant other, which it does not.

Given that the Premise does not provide information about the purpose or recipient of the items, the Hypothesis is plausible but not certain.

Therefore, the relationship is:

   - ""Dude has filled the room with flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.""
   - This means that the room is currently full of flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Dude has emptied the room of flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.""
   - This means that the room currently has no flowers, teddy bears, or cheesy cards.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the room is filled with these items.
   - The Hypothesis states that the room is emptied of these items.
   - These two statements are directly contradictory. If the room is filled with these items, it cannot simultaneously be emptied of them.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

causative-with-CxN,partial,Dude has filled the room with flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.,Dude has moved flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards into the room.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Dude has filled the room with flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.""
   - This means that the room is now full of flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Dude has moved flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards into the room.""
   - This means that Dude has taken actions to place flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards into the room.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis states that Dude has moved the items into the room, which is a necessary action to fill the room with those items.
   - The Premise states that the room is filled with those items, which implies that the items have been moved into the room.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is a necessary condition for the Premise to be true. If the room is filled with flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards, it must be the case that these items were moved into the room.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,An enormous chandelier filled the room with a stunning display of reflected light.,The room had a grand crystal chandelier displayed in its center.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

**Premise:** An enormous chandelier filled the room with a stunning display of reflected light.

**Hypothesis:** The room had a grand crystal chandelier displayed in its center.

1. **Identify Key Elements in the Premise:**
   - An enormous chandelier
   - Filled the room
   - Stunning display of reflected light

2. **Identify Key Elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - The room had a grand crystal chandelier
   - Displayed in its center

3. **Compare the Key Elements:**
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis mention a chandelier in the room.
   - The Premise describes the chandelier as ""enormous"" and mentions its effect (filling the room with a stunning display of reflected light).
   - The Hypothesis describes the chandelier as ""grand"" and specifies its location (displayed in the center of the room).

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise. It is plausible that an enormous chandelier could be described as grand and could be located in the center of the room.
   - However, the Premise does not explicitly state that the chandelier is in the center of the room or that it is made of crystal. These details are additional assumptions made in the Hypothesis.

Given these points, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

**Relation: 1**",**Relation: 1**,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,An enormous chandelier filled the room with a stunning display of reflected light.,A small chandelier filled the room with an ordinary display of reflected light.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: An enormous chandelier filled the room with a stunning display of reflected light.
Hypothesis: A small chandelier filled the room with an ordinary display of reflected light.

1. **Compare the size of the chandelier:**
   - Premise: ""An enormous chandelier""
   - Hypothesis: ""A small chandelier""
   - These descriptions are contradictory. An enormous chandelier cannot be the same as a small chandelier.

2. **Compare the type of display:**
   - Premise: ""a stunning display of reflected light""
   - Hypothesis: ""an ordinary display of reflected light""
   - These descriptions are also contradictory. A stunning display is not the same as an ordinary display.

Given these points, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - **Premise**: Describes the aroma filling the room due to freshly ground coffee beans.
   - **Hypothesis**: States that aromatic coffee beans were ground for a fresh cup of coffee.

2. **Information Overlap**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis mention ""coffee beans"" and the action of them being ""ground.""
   - The Premise focuses on the aroma filling the room.
   - The Hypothesis focuses on the purpose of grinding the beans, which is to make a fresh cup of coffee.

3. **Inference Check**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state that the coffee beans were ground for a fresh cup of coffee. It only mentions the aroma filling the room.
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information about the purpose of grinding the beans, which is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the purpose of grinding the coffee beans.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

   - ""Stale whole coffee beans filled the room with an unattractive, otherworldly scent.""
   - Key points:
     - The coffee beans are stale and whole.
     - The scent is unattractive and otherworldly.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The state of the coffee beans in the Premise (freshly ground) is different from the state in the Hypothesis (stale whole).
   - The aroma described in the Premise (seductive, earthy) is different from the scent described in the Hypothesis (unattractive, otherworldly).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis describes a situation that is fundamentally different from the Premise in terms of the condition of the coffee beans and the resulting aroma/scent.
   - Given the differences, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

**Hypothesis:** The room was filled with a seductive, earthly aroma from freshly ground coffee beans.

1. **Content Comparison:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention ""freshly ground coffee beans.""
   - Both state that these coffee beans filled the room with an aroma.
   - The aroma is described as ""seductive"" and ""earthy"" in both sentences.

2. **Paraphrasing Check:**
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. The order of the words is slightly different, but the meaning remains the same.
   - The Hypothesis uses ""earthly"" instead of ""earthy,"" but this appears to be a minor typographical error or a slight variation in wording that does not change the overall meaning.

3. **Logical Consistency:**
   - There is no new information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any uncertainty or additional conditions that would make it only possibly true.

   - This statement suggests that the advertisements Samsung has used are specifically described as ""tasteful"" and ""funny.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Samsung has extensively advertised, but it does not specify the nature or quality of the advertisements.
   - The Hypothesis adds additional information about the nature of the advertisements, describing them as ""tasteful"" and ""funny.""

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the specific qualities of the advertisements mentioned in the Hypothesis.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is not definitely true (Entailment) nor definitely false (Contradiction) based on the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Samsung has done a lot of advertising (""flooded the market"").
   - The Hypothesis states that Samsung has done very little advertising (""held back"").

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The two statements are directly contradictory. If Samsung has flooded the market with advertising, it cannot simultaneously be true that they have held back with their advertising.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.,The market is flooded with Samsung's advertising.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.""
Hypothesis: ""The market is flooded with Samsung's advertising.""

1. **Check for Entailment (0)**:
   - The Premise states that ""Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.""
   - The Hypothesis states that ""The market is flooded with Samsung's advertising.""
   - Both statements convey the same information: Samsung's advertising is prevalent in the market.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that is not already present in the Premise.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil that was sold to at least five countries.""
   - This statement suggests that the cheap oil introduced by Saudi Arabia was sold to at least five countries.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not specify the number of countries to which the cheap oil was sold. It only mentions the action of flooding the market with cheap oil to recover market share.
   - The Hypothesis adds a specific detail about the oil being sold to at least five countries, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information (the oil being sold to at least five countries) that is not present in the Premise.
   - This new information does not contradict the Premise, but it is also not entailed by it. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the specific detail about the number of countries.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the final output is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.,Saudi reduced the market's supply of cheap oil so they could deteriorate their market share.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.""
Hypothesis: ""Saudi reduced the market's supply of cheap oil so they could deteriorate their market share.""

1. **Identify the key actions and intentions in the Premise:**
   - Action: ""flooded the market with cheap oil""
   - Intention: ""recover their market share""

2. **Identify the key actions and intentions in the Hypothesis:**
   - Action: ""reduced the market's supply of cheap oil""
   - Intention: ""deteriorate their market share""

3. **Compare the actions:**
   - The Premise states that Saudi ""flooded the market with cheap oil,"" which means they increased the supply of cheap oil.
   - The Hypothesis states that Saudi ""reduced the market's supply of cheap oil,"" which means they decreased the supply of cheap oil.

4. **Compare the intentions:**
   - The Premise states that the intention was to ""recover their market share,"" which implies a positive outcome for Saudi.
   - The Hypothesis states that the intention was to ""deteriorate their market share,"" which implies a negative outcome for Saudi.

5. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The actions in the Premise and Hypothesis are directly opposite (increasing vs. decreasing supply).
   - The intentions in the Premise and Hypothesis are also directly opposite (recovering vs. deteriorating market share).

Given these oppositions, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship is a contradiction.

   - This statement suggests that the Chinese apples are the largest and juiciest available on the market.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about the quantity and type (juice-grade) of apples the Chinese have introduced to the market.
   - The Hypothesis makes a qualitative claim about the size and juiciness of the apples.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the size or juiciness of the apples, only that they are juice-grade and in large quantities.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information given in the Premise. There is no direct contradiction, nor is there a definite entailment.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

Premise: The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.
Hypothesis: The Chinese already have under produced in the market with juice-grade apples.

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The phrase ""flooded the market"" implies that there is an abundance or oversupply of juice-grade apples in the market due to the Chinese.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The phrase ""under produced"" implies that there is a shortage or insufficient supply of juice-grade apples in the market due to the Chinese.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise states that there is an oversupply of juice-grade apples.
   - The Hypothesis states that there is an undersupply of juice-grade apples.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The two statements are directly contradictory. If the market is flooded with juice-grade apples, it cannot simultaneously be under produced.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Juice-grade apples have already been flooded in the market by the Chinese.""
   - This statement is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. It conveys the same information: the Chinese have introduced a large quantity of juice-grade apples into the market.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same event and the same actors (the Chinese) performing the same action (flooding the market) with the same object (juice-grade apples).
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the same information, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

Hypothesis: ""He turned his face to the wall and covered it out of embarrassment.""

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - **Premise**: The person turned to the wall and covered his face with a pillow.
   - **Hypothesis**: The person turned his face to the wall and covered it out of embarrassment.

2. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis mention the action of turning to the wall and covering the face.
   - The Premise specifies that the face was covered with a pillow.
   - The Hypothesis adds a reason for the action, stating it was out of embarrassment, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information (the reason for the action) that is not present in the Premise.
   - The action described in the Hypothesis is consistent with the action described in the Premise, but the reason for the action is speculative.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise (the reason for the action is not confirmed or denied by the Premise), the relationship is Neutral.

Therefore, the relation is:

Premise: ""Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.""
Hypothesis: ""Turning away from the wall he uncovered his face with a pillow.""

1. **Identify the main actions in the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Premise: ""Turning to the wall"" and ""covered his face with a pillow.""
   - Hypothesis: ""Turning away from the wall"" and ""uncovered his face with a pillow.""

2. **Compare the actions:**
   - The Premise states that he turned to the wall and covered his face with a pillow.
   - The Hypothesis states that he turned away from the wall and uncovered his face with a pillow.

3. **Determine the relationship between the actions:**
   - The actions in the Hypothesis are the opposite of those in the Premise. In the Premise, he is covering his face, while in the Hypothesis, he is uncovering his face. Additionally, the directions of turning (to the wall vs. away from the wall) are also opposite.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the actions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict the actions described in the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Identify the actions and their sequence in the Premise:**
   - Action 1: Turning to the wall.
   - Action 2: He covered his face with a pillow.

2. **Identify the actions and their sequence in the Hypothesis:**
   - Action 1: He covered his face with a pillow.
   - Action 2: As he turned toward the wall.

3. **Compare the actions and their sequence:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same two actions: turning to the wall and covering his face with a pillow.
   - The sequence of actions in the Hypothesis is slightly rephrased but essentially conveys the same meaning as the Premise.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but maintains the same meaning and sequence of actions.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and does not introduce any contradictory or additional information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

   - Hypothesis: ""challenged him with tests, quizzes and homework.""
   - Analysis: This part of the Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise. Both statements are identical in this regard.

3. **Overall Analysis:**
   - The Hypothesis adds a specific detail about the type of knowledge (pertinent, real-world) that is not explicitly mentioned in the Premise. This makes the Hypothesis a possible but not definite extension of the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,"The school filled his head with knowledge, challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.","The school emptied his head of knowledge, easing him with tests, quizzes, and homework.",2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

Premise: ""The school filled his head with knowledge, challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.""
- This statement indicates that the school provided him with knowledge and presented him with various academic challenges.

Hypothesis: ""The school emptied his head of knowledge, easing him with tests, quizzes, and homework.""
- This statement suggests the opposite: that the school removed knowledge from his head and made tests, quizzes, and homework easier for him.

Now, let's determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis:

1. **Contradiction Check**:
   - The Premise states that the school ""filled his head with knowledge,"" while the Hypothesis states that the school ""emptied his head of knowledge."" These two statements are directly opposite in meaning.
   - The Premise states that the school ""challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework,"" while the Hypothesis states that the school ""eased him with tests, quizzes, and homework."" Again, these statements are directly opposite in meaning.

Since both parts of the Hypothesis directly contradict the Premise, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,"The school filled his head with knowledge, challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.","The school challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework, filled his head with knowledge.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The school filled his head with knowledge, challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.""
Hypothesis: ""The school challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework, filled his head with knowledge.""

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the same elements: the school, filling his head with knowledge, and challenging him with tests, quizzes, and homework.
   - The order of the elements is different, but the content is identical.

2. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is simply a rephrasing of the Premise with the same meaning.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise with no additional or contradictory information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,"Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.","Susan was a trapper by trade, specializing in mink hats.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.""
   - This sentence indicates that Susan deceived someone by trapping them and telling them lies.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Susan was a trapper by trade, specializing in mink hats.""
   - This sentence suggests that Susan's profession is trapping animals, specifically for making mink hats.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis discuss different contexts. The Premise talks about Susan deceiving someone, while the Hypothesis talks about Susan's profession as a trapper.
   - There is no direct connection between the act of deception described in the Premise and the profession described in the Hypothesis.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not logically follow from the Premise. The Premise does not provide any information about Susan's profession, so we cannot conclude that she is a trapper specializing in mink hats.
   - The Hypothesis is not necessarily false given the Premise, but it is also not supported by it. Therefore, the relationship is neutral.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,"Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.","Susan let him free, cleared his head of lies.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.""
   - This indicates that Susan has confined him and deceived him by telling lies.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Susan let him free, cleared his head of lies.""
   - This suggests that Susan has released him and removed the lies from his mind.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Susan trapped him and filled his head with lies.
   - The Hypothesis states the opposite: Susan let him free and cleared his head of lies.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict the actions described in the Premise.
   - If Susan trapped him, she did not let him free.
   - If Susan filled his head with lies, she did not clear his head of lies.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,"Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.","Susan filled his head with lies, trapped him.",0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.""
   - Susan performed two actions: trapping him and filling his head with lies.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Susan filled his head with lies, trapped him.""
   - Susan performed the same two actions: filling his head with lies and trapping him, but in a different order.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same two actions performed by Susan.
   - The order of the actions is different, but the content and the actions themselves are identical.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.
   - The order of actions does not affect the truth of the Hypothesis given the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the Premise, the relationship is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,"They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.",They made him take pills that were supposed to ease his headache.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.""
   - This suggests that the pills had a negative or unusual effect, causing a sensation described as ""cold, silent noise"" in his head.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""They made him take pills that were supposed to ease his headache.""
   - This suggests that the intention behind giving the pills was to alleviate a headache.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes the actual effect of the pills, which is negative (""cold, silent noise"").
   - The Hypothesis describes the intended effect of the pills, which is positive (to ease a headache).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis are discussing different aspects of the same event: the Premise talks about the actual effect, while the Hypothesis talks about the intended effect.
   - The Hypothesis does not directly contradict the Premise because it is possible that the pills were intended to ease a headache but ended up causing an adverse effect instead.
   - However, the Hypothesis is not definitely true given the Premise because the Premise does not mention anything about the intended effect of the pills.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as **Neutral**.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,"They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.","They made him give away pills that emptied his head of cold, silent noise.",2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.""
   - This means that he was forced to consume pills, and as a result, his head was filled with cold, silent noise.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""They made him give away pills that emptied his head of cold, silent noise.""
   - This means that he was forced to give away pills, and as a result, his head was emptied of cold, silent noise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that taking pills filled his head with cold, silent noise.
   - The Hypothesis states that giving away pills emptied his head of cold, silent noise.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are opposite: taking pills vs. giving away pills.
   - The effects described are also opposite: filling his head vs. emptying his head.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

**Relation Output**: 2",**Relation Output**: 2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,"They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.","His head was filled with cold, silent noise from pills they made him take.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.""
   - This sentence states that ""they"" (unspecified people) forced ""him"" (unspecified person) to take pills, and as a result, his head was filled with ""cold, silent noise.""

2. **Hypothesis**: ""His head was filled with cold, silent noise from pills they made him take.""
   - This sentence states that his head was filled with ""cold, silent noise"" and attributes the cause to pills that ""they"" made him take.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: the act of taking pills and the resulting effect of ""cold, silent noise"" in his head.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise without adding or contradicting any information.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise with no additional information or contradiction.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.,"There are other teachers, but one was trying to conceal her body with a sheet.",1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.""
   - This sentence indicates that a specific teacher took an action to cover her body with a black sheet.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""There are other teachers, but one was trying to conceal her body with a sheet.""
   - This sentence suggests that there are multiple teachers, and one of them was attempting to conceal her body with a sheet.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that one teacher took action to cover or conceal her body with a sheet.
   - The Hypothesis adds the information that there are other teachers, which is not explicitly stated in the Premise but is not contradicted by it either.
   - The action described in the Hypothesis (""trying to conceal her body with a sheet"") is consistent with the action described in the Premise (""covered her body with a black sheet"").

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it is consistent with it and adds some additional context (the presence of other teachers).
   - The additional context does not affect the truth of the action described in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the final output is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.,One of the teachers left after removing a black sheet from her body.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.""
Hypothesis: ""One of the teachers left after removing a black sheet from her body.""

1. **Identify the actions in the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Premise: A teacher covered her body with a black sheet.
   - Hypothesis: A teacher left after removing a black sheet from her body.

2. **Compare the actions:**
   - The Premise describes the action of covering her body with a black sheet.
   - The Hypothesis describes the action of removing a black sheet from her body and then leaving.

3. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are opposite. The Premise involves covering her body, while the Hypothesis involves removing the cover.
   - Since the actions are contradictory, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.,One of the teachers covered her body with a black sheet after she came along.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.
Hypothesis: One of the teachers covered her body with a black sheet after she came along.

1. **Identify the main actions and subjects in both sentences:**
   - Premise: A teacher came along and covered her body with a black sheet.
   - Hypothesis: A teacher covered her body with a black sheet after she came along.

2. **Compare the actions and their sequence:**
   - In the Premise, the sequence is: the teacher came along → the teacher covered her body with a black sheet.
   - In the Hypothesis, the sequence is: she came along → the teacher covered her body with a black sheet.

3. **Check for consistency:**
   - The Hypothesis implies that the action of covering her body with a black sheet happened after she came along, which is consistent with the Premise where the teacher came along first and then covered her body with a black sheet.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The sequence of events in the Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,Howze filled her house with music and color.,Howze was the best roommate she had ever had.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""Howze filled her house with music and color.""
   - This statement tells us that Howze contributed to the environment of the house by adding music and color.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""Howze was the best roommate she had ever had.""
   - This statement makes a subjective claim about Howze being the best roommate.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides specific actions that Howze took (filling the house with music and color).
   - The Hypothesis makes a general, subjective evaluation of Howze as a roommate.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise would need to provide sufficient information to conclude that Howze was the best roommate. The Premise does not provide enough information to make this definitive conclusion.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis. It is possible that filling the house with music and color contributed to Howze being considered the best roommate, but this is not certain from the information given.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: There is no information in the Premise that directly contradicts the Hypothesis.

Given that the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude the Hypothesis but also does not contradict it, the relationship is best described as Neutral.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,Howze filled her house with music and color.,Howze emptied her house of music and color.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Howze filled her house with music and color.""
   - This statement indicates that Howze added music and color to her house, making it full of these elements.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Howze emptied her house of music and color.""
   - This statement indicates that Howze removed music and color from her house, making it devoid of these elements.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the house is filled with music and color.
   - The Hypothesis states that the house is emptied of music and color.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the house is filled with music and color, it cannot simultaneously be emptied of music and color.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final output:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Howze filled her house with music and color.,The house was filled with music and color by Howze.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Howze filled her house with music and color.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""The house was filled with music and color by Howze.""

- **Content Analysis**:
  - The Premise states that Howze is the agent who filled her house with music and color.
  - The Hypothesis states that the house was filled with music and color by Howze.

- **Paraphrasing Check**:
  - The Hypothesis is essentially a passive voice transformation of the Premise. Both statements convey the same information: Howze is the one who filled the house with music and color.

- **Inference Relation**:
  - Since the Hypothesis is a direct restatement of the Premise in passive voice, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

Final output:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.,The red wine bottle was opened by him and he poured her a glass full of it.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The cork came out with a pleasant pop"" suggests that a bottle was opened.
   - ""He filled her glass with the rich red liquid"" indicates that the liquid (presumably wine) was poured into a glass.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The red wine bottle was opened by him"" aligns with the cork coming out in the Premise.
   - ""He poured her a glass full of it"" matches with him filling her glass with the red liquid in the Premise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis states that the bottle was specifically a red wine bottle, which is a reasonable inference given the description of the liquid as ""rich red"" in the Premise.
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis (opening the bottle and pouring the wine) directly correspond to the actions described in the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise and there are no contradictions or additional information that would make the Hypothesis uncertain, the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.,The cork came out with a horrible pop and he emptied her glass of the rich red liquid.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.""
Hypothesis: ""The cork came out with a horrible pop and he emptied her glass of the rich red liquid.""

1. **Compare the descriptions of the cork popping:**
   - Premise: ""The cork came out with a pleasant pop.""
   - Hypothesis: ""The cork came out with a horrible pop.""
   - These descriptions are contradictory. ""Pleasant"" and ""horrible"" are opposite in sentiment.

2. **Compare the actions related to the glass:**
   - Premise: ""He filled her glass with the rich red liquid.""
   - Hypothesis: ""He emptied her glass of the rich red liquid.""
   - These actions are also contradictory. ""Filled"" and ""emptied"" are opposite actions.

Given these two points of contradiction, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.,He filled her glass with the rich red liquid that came from opening the cork with a pleasant pop.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

Premise: ""The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.""
Hypothesis: ""He filled her glass with the rich red liquid that came from opening the cork with a pleasant pop.""

1. **Identify the main events in the Premise:**
   - The cork came out with a pleasant pop.
   - He filled her glass with the rich red liquid.

2. **Identify the main events in the Hypothesis:**
   - He filled her glass with the rich red liquid.
   - The liquid came from opening the cork with a pleasant pop.

3. **Compare the events:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the cork coming out with a pleasant pop.
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention filling her glass with the rich red liquid.
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states that the rich red liquid came from the cork that popped, which is implied in the Premise.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise with the same meaning.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

causative-with-CxN,partial,The waiter filled her glass with white wine.,She ordered the white wine in a glass.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The waiter filled her glass with white wine.""
   - This statement tells us that a waiter performed the action of filling a glass with white wine for a female individual.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""She ordered the white wine in a glass.""
   - This statement suggests that the female individual ordered white wine to be served in a glass.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about whether the female individual ordered the white wine. It only states that the waiter filled her glass with white wine.
   - The Hypothesis introduces the idea that she ordered the white wine, which is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not confirm or deny whether she ordered the white wine, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information given in the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,The waiter filled her glass with white wine.,The waiter emptied her glass of white wine.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The waiter filled her glass with white wine.
Hypothesis: The waiter emptied her glass of white wine.

1. **Identify the main actions in the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Premise: The action is ""filled her glass with white wine.""
   - Hypothesis: The action is ""emptied her glass of white wine.""

2. **Compare the actions:**
   - ""Filled"" and ""emptied"" are opposite actions. If the glass is filled, it cannot be empty at the same time.

3. **Determine the relationship:**
   - Since the actions are contradictory (filling vs. emptying), the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,The waiter filled her glass with white wine.,Her glass was filled with white wine by the waiter.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The waiter filled her glass with white wine.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""Her glass was filled with white wine by the waiter.""

- **Content Analysis**:
  - The Premise states that the waiter performed the action of filling her glass with white wine.
  - The Hypothesis states that her glass was filled with white wine by the waiter.

- **Paraphrasing Check**:
  - The Hypothesis is essentially a passive voice transformation of the Premise. Both statements convey the same event and the same participants (the waiter, her glass, and white wine).

- **Logical Consistency**:
  - If the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must also be true because they describe the same event in different grammatical structures.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

   - This statement describes an action where Virginia Woolf puts rocks in her pockets and then walks into a river.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Virginia Woolf emptied her pockets of rocks and walked away from the river.""
   - This statement describes an action where Virginia Woolf removes rocks from her pockets and then walks away from the river.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.
   - The Hypothesis states the opposite actions: she emptied her pockets of rocks and walked away from the river.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict the actions described in the Premise.
   - If Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river, it is not possible for her to have emptied her pockets of rocks and walked away from the river at the same time.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.,Virginia Woolf walked into a river after filling her pockets with rocks.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.""
Hypothesis: ""Virginia Woolf walked into a river after filling her pockets with rocks.""

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The Premise states two actions: Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and then walked into a river.
   - The Hypothesis states the same two actions but emphasizes the sequence by using ""after.""

2. **Sequence and Logical Consistency**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of events: filling pockets with rocks first, then walking into a river.
   - The use of ""after"" in the Hypothesis explicitly states the sequence, which is implicitly understood in the Premise.

3. **Checking for Contradiction**:
   - There is no contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis. Both describe the same events in the same order.

4. **Checking for Neutrality**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or uncertainty. It simply rephrases the Premise with a focus on the sequence.

5. **Checking for Entailment**:
   - The Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise with the same meaning and sequence of events. Therefore, if the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must also be true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.""
   - This means that a blizzard caused snow to accumulate on their bodies.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""A blizzard soon took snow away from their bodies.""
   - This means that a blizzard caused snow to be removed from their bodies.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the blizzard added snow to their bodies.
   - The Hypothesis states that the blizzard removed snow from their bodies.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are directly opposite to each other.
   - If the Premise is true (the blizzard covered their bodies with snow), then the Hypothesis (the blizzard took snow away from their bodies) cannot be true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

causative-with-CxN,partial,A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.,Their bodies were soon covered with snow from the blizzard.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.
Hypothesis: Their bodies were soon covered with snow from the blizzard.

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that a blizzard covered their bodies with snow.
   - The Hypothesis states that their bodies were covered with snow from the blizzard.

2. **Semantic Equivalence**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: a blizzard causing snow to cover their bodies.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise without changing the meaning.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis.
   - The Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the information provided in the Premise, the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The harder they come, the harder they fall.",They are likely to be injured if they fall hard.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""The harder they come, the harder they fall.""
   - This statement suggests that the more force or intensity someone or something has when they arrive or start, the more severe or impactful their downfall will be.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""They are likely to be injured if they fall hard.""
   - This statement suggests that if someone or something falls with great force or intensity, there is a high likelihood of injury.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise talks about the severity of the fall being proportional to the intensity of the arrival or start.
   - The Hypothesis talks about the likelihood of injury being high if the fall is hard.

4. **Inference:**
   - The Premise implies a severe fall due to a hard start, which aligns with the Hypothesis that a hard fall is likely to cause injury.
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise and is a reasonable consequence of a hard fall.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is a logical extension of the Premise, suggesting that if the fall is hard (as implied by the Premise), injury is likely.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The harder they come, the harder they fall.",How hard they fall is dependent on their actions.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The harder they come, the harder they fall.""
- This statement suggests a direct correlation between the intensity or difficulty of something (or someone) and the severity of the consequences or failure.

Hypothesis: ""How hard they fall is dependent on their actions.""
- This statement suggests that the severity of the fall is influenced by their actions.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

1. **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must directly imply that the severity of the fall is dependent on their actions. The Premise does not explicitly mention actions; it only mentions the correlation between coming hard and falling hard.

2. **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information about the role of actions in determining the severity of the fall. It only states a correlation between the intensity of coming and falling, without specifying the cause of the fall.

3. **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must directly imply that the severity of the fall is not dependent on their actions. The Premise does not contradict the idea that actions could influence the severity of the fall; it simply does not address it.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The harder they come, the harder they fall.",They will fall softly regardless of how hard they come at me.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The harder they come, the harder they fall.""
   - This means that the more force or intensity with which something approaches, the greater the impact or consequence when it fails or is defeated.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""They will fall softly regardless of how hard they come at me.""
   - This suggests that no matter the intensity or force with which something approaches, the impact or consequence will be minimal or gentle.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states a direct correlation between the intensity of the approach and the severity of the fall.
   - The Hypothesis contradicts this by stating that the fall will be soft regardless of the intensity of the approach.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. According to the Premise, a harder approach results in a harder fall, while the Hypothesis claims that the fall will be soft regardless of the approach's intensity.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

comparative-correlative,partial,"The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.",He has a very annoying voice.,1,"Let's analyze the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.""
   - This statement suggests that the presence of ""he"" causes increasing misery over time.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""He has a very annoying voice.""
   - This statement provides a specific reason for why ""he"" might be causing misery, implying that his annoying voice could be a factor.

3. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must directly imply that ""he"" has an annoying voice. The Premise does not specify the reason for the misery, so it does not directly entail the Hypothesis.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise indicates that ""he"" causes misery, but it does not specify the reason. An annoying voice could be one possible reason among many.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to imply that ""he"" does not have an annoying voice. The Premise does not provide any information that contradicts the possibility of ""he"" having an annoying voice.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relationship is Neutral (1), as the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise.

comparative-correlative,partial,"The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.","If he is around longer today, I will probably not enjoy myself.",0,"Let's analyze the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.""
   - This statement indicates a direct correlation between the duration of someone's presence and the speaker's level of misery. The longer the person is around, the more miserable the speaker becomes.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""If he is around longer today, I will probably not enjoy myself.""
   - This statement suggests that if the person is around for a longer period today, the speaker will likely not have a good time.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker's misery increases with the duration of the person's presence.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker will probably not enjoy themselves if the person is around longer today.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise. If the speaker becomes more miserable the longer the person is around, it logically follows that the speaker will probably not enjoy themselves if the person is around for a longer period today.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.",I'm happiest on the days where he is around a lot.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.""
- This statement indicates a direct relationship between the duration of someone's presence and the speaker's level of misery. The longer the person is around, the more miserable the speaker becomes.

Hypothesis: ""I'm happiest on the days where he is around a lot.""
- This statement indicates that the speaker's happiness increases with the presence of the same person. The more the person is around, the happier the speaker becomes.

Now, let's compare the two statements:
- The Premise states that the speaker becomes more miserable the longer the person is around.
- The Hypothesis states that the speaker becomes happier the longer the person is around.

These two statements are directly contradictory. The Premise suggests increased misery with the person's presence, while the Hypothesis suggests increased happiness with the same person's presence.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

comparative-correlative,partial,"The more I studied, the less I understood.",I studied a lot for my recent exams.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""The more I studied, the less I understood.""
   - This statement suggests a negative correlation between the amount of studying and the level of understanding. It implies that increased studying led to decreased understanding.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""I studied a lot for my recent exams.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker engaged in a significant amount of studying for their recent exams.

3. **Relation Analysis**:
   - The Premise does not directly state how much studying was done; it only describes the relationship between studying and understanding.
   - The Hypothesis provides a specific instance of studying a lot, but it does not address the level of understanding.
   - The Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise in that it does not contradict the negative correlation described. However, the Premise does not necessarily entail the Hypothesis because the Premise could be true regardless of the specific amount of studying done in any particular instance.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the Hypothesis.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more I studied, the less I understood.",I got more confused as I studied.,0,"Let's analyze the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The more I studied, the less I understood.""
   - This statement suggests a negative correlation between studying and understanding. As the amount of studying increases, the level of understanding decreases.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I got more confused as I studied.""
   - This statement suggests that studying led to increased confusion.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a negative outcome associated with increased studying.
   - The Premise states that understanding decreases with more studying.
   - The Hypothesis states that confusion increases with more studying.

4. **Inference**:
   - Decreased understanding and increased confusion are closely related concepts. If understanding decreases, it is reasonable to infer that confusion increases.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise in different words, focusing on the aspect of confusion rather than understanding.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The more I studied, the less I understood.""
   - This statement suggests a negative correlation between studying and understanding. The more effort put into studying, the less understanding is achieved.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I felt like my studying helped me really grasp the subject.""
   - This statement suggests a positive outcome from studying, indicating that studying led to a better understanding of the subject.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that increased studying leads to decreased understanding.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that increased studying leads to increased understanding.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis present opposite outcomes of studying. The Premise suggests a negative effect of studying on understanding, while the Hypothesis suggests a positive effect.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

comparative-correlative,partial,"It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.",This drug can be harmful for older patients.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.""
   - This statement suggests that the effectiveness of the drug decreases as the age of the patient increases. It does not provide any information about the drug being harmful, only that it becomes less effective.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""This drug can be harmful for older patients.""
   - This statement suggests that the drug can cause harm to older patients. 

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about the drug being less effective for older patients, but it does not mention anything about the drug being harmful.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new concept (harmfulness) that is not addressed in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide information about the drug being harmful, we cannot definitively conclude that the Hypothesis is true or false based on the Premise alone.
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as the Premise only discusses effectiveness, not harm.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.",This drug is best suited for treating patients who are on the younger side.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.""
- This statement suggests that the effectiveness of the drug decreases as the age of the patient increases.

Hypothesis: ""This drug is best suited for treating patients who are on the younger side.""
- This statement suggests that the drug is more effective for younger patients.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

1. **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise directly supports it without any additional assumptions.
   - The Premise indicates that the drug is less effective for older patients, which implies that it is more effective for younger patients.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise.

2. **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis would be possibly true or false if the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny it.
   - The Premise provides a clear indication about the effectiveness of the drug relative to age, so it is not neutral.

3. **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise directly contradicts it.
   - There is no contradiction here; the Premise supports the Hypothesis.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

comparative-correlative,partial,"It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.",Ideally patients that take this drug are advanced in age.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.""
- This statement suggests that the effectiveness of the drug decreases as the age of the patient increases.

Hypothesis: ""Ideally patients that take this drug are advanced in age.""
- This statement suggests that it is preferable for patients who take this drug to be older.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

1. **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, it must be definitely true given the Premise. However, the Premise indicates that the drug is less effective for older patients, which contradicts the idea that it is ideal for older patients to take the drug. Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be definitely true based on the Premise.

2. **Neutral (1)**: For the Hypothesis to be neutral, it must be a statement that may or may not be true given the Premise. However, the Premise directly suggests that the drug is less effective for older patients, which makes it unlikely that the Hypothesis (which states that ideally, older patients should take the drug) is neutral.

3. **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, it must be definitely false given the Premise. Since the Premise states that the drug is less effective for older patients, it directly contradicts the Hypothesis that ideally, older patients should take the drug.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

### Premise:
""Applied to health care, the longer we wait for it the worse off we are and the longer we put it off the longer it will take to fine tune it.""

### Hypothesis:
""Waiting longer for healthcare will make it more expensive to implement.""

### Analysis:
1. **Premise Breakdown**:
   - The premise states two main points:
     1. Waiting longer for healthcare makes us worse off.
     2. Delaying healthcare increases the time needed to fine-tune it.

2. **Hypothesis Breakdown**:
   - The hypothesis suggests that waiting longer for healthcare will increase its cost.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise does not explicitly mention the cost of healthcare. It focuses on the negative consequences of waiting, such as being worse off and needing more time to fine-tune healthcare.
   - The hypothesis introduces a new aspect (cost) that is not directly addressed in the premise.

### Conclusion:
- The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that waiting longer will make healthcare more expensive, but it does not contradict it either.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that delaying healthcare has negative consequences: ""the longer we wait for it the worse off we are"" and ""the longer we put it off the longer it will take to fine tune it.""
   - This implies that timely healthcare is crucial for better outcomes and efficiency.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Putting off adequate healthcare will not serve the people's best interests.""
   - This suggests that delaying healthcare is detrimental to people's well-being.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise and the hypothesis both convey the idea that delaying healthcare is harmful.
   - The premise provides a detailed explanation of the negative effects of delaying healthcare, while the hypothesis summarizes this by stating it is not in people's best interests.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis is a direct conclusion that can be drawn from the premise.
   - Since the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise, the relationship is one of entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that delaying healthcare has negative consequences: ""the longer we wait for it the worse off we are.""
   - Additionally, it mentions that delaying healthcare reforms will make the process of fine-tuning them take longer: ""the longer we put it off the longer it will take to fine tune it.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis suggests that it might be beneficial to continue delaying healthcare reforms: ""It's probably best to keep putting off applying healthcare reforms.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise clearly indicates that delaying healthcare reforms is detrimental (""the worse off we are"" and ""the longer it will take to fine tune it"").
   - The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests the opposite, that delaying healthcare reforms might be beneficial.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise by suggesting a course of action that the premise states will have negative consequences, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more bureaucrats run charities, the more people who need them.""
   - This suggests a correlation between the number of bureaucrats running charities and the number of people who need the charities. It implies that an increase in bureaucrats running charities leads to an increase in people needing the charities.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Bureaucrats are always greedy.""
   - This is a general statement about the nature of bureaucrats, suggesting that they are inherently greedy.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise discusses a specific situation involving bureaucrats running charities and the resulting need for those charities.
   - The Hypothesis makes a broad claim about the character of bureaucrats, without directly addressing the specific situation described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would need to be a direct logical consequence of the Premise. However, the Premise does not provide information that directly supports the claim that bureaucrats are always greedy.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true or false regardless of the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the general character of bureaucrats.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would need to be directly opposed to the information in the Premise. There is no direct contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis.

Given that the Premise does not provide sufficient information to either confirm or deny the general statement about bureaucrats being greedy, the relationship is best described as Neutral.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.""
   - This means that senior management's involvement increases with the cost of the decision.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Senior management is always micromanaging our decisions.""
   - This implies that senior management is involved in all decisions, regardless of their cost.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise suggests a conditional involvement of senior management based on the expense of the decision.
   - The Hypothesis suggests an unconditional involvement of senior management in all decisions.

4. **Inference**:

   - This statement suggests that as the cost of a decision increases, the involvement of senior management also increases.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Senior management likes to oversee decisions that are most likely to cost a lot of money.""
   - This statement suggests that senior management has a preference for overseeing decisions that are likely to be expensive.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a correlation between the cost of a decision and the involvement of senior management.
   - The Hypothesis suggests a reason for this correlation, implying that senior management has a preference for overseeing expensive decisions.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise. The Premise provides a factual correlation, and the Hypothesis offers a plausible explanation for this correlation.
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise, nor does it introduce any new information that would make it uncertain.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.""
   - This means that as the cost of a decision increases, the involvement of senior management also increases.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Senior management doesn't care much about the cost of potential decisions.""
   - This suggests that senior management is indifferent to the cost of decisions, implying that their involvement is not influenced by the cost.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states a direct relationship between the cost of decisions and the involvement of senior management (higher cost leads to more involvement).
   - The Hypothesis states that senior management is indifferent to the cost, which contradicts the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise, the relationship is a contradiction.

   - This statement suggests that ""this"" task is a prerequisite for the game to begin.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the speed of completing the task affects how soon the game can continue.
   - The Hypothesis states that the task must be completed before the game can start.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise because if the task must be done before the game can start, then doing it faster would indeed allow the game to start sooner.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.",We don't have to do this before the game starts.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.""
   - This implies that there is a task (""this"") that needs to be completed before the game can proceed. The faster this task is done, the sooner the game can start.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""We don't have to do this before the game starts.""
   - This suggests that the task mentioned in the premise is not a prerequisite for starting the game.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise implies that the task must be done before the game can proceed.
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that the task does not need to be done before the game starts.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis cannot be true if the premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Final Relation Output: 2",Final Relation Output: 2,False,False,True,2
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.",More snow makes skiers go faster down the slopes.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.""
   - This statement suggests that an increase in snow leads to a decrease in danger for skiers. It implies that more snow creates safer conditions for skiing.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""More snow makes skiers go faster down the slopes.""
   - This statement suggests that an increase in snow causes skiers to go faster.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about safety and danger in relation to the amount of snow.
   - The Hypothesis talks about the speed of skiers in relation to the amount of snow.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the speed of skiers. It only mentions the safety aspect.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new concept (speed) that is not addressed in the Premise.

Since the Premise does not provide enough information to determine whether the Hypothesis is true or false, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.",It's most safe to ski if there has been a substantial snowfall recently.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.""
   - This statement suggests that an increase in snowfall correlates with a decrease in danger for skiers.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""It's most safe to ski if there has been a substantial snowfall recently.""
   - This statement suggests that skiing is safest when there has been a significant amount of recent snowfall.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis are discussing the relationship between snowfall and skier safety.
   - The Premise states that more snow leads to less danger, implying increased safety.
   - The Hypothesis states that substantial snowfall makes skiing most safe, which aligns with the idea that more snow increases safety.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because both statements are essentially expressing the same idea: more snow leads to safer skiing conditions.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.",It is too dangerous to ski on days when there was heavy snow recently.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.""
   - This statement suggests that an increase in snow leads to a decrease in danger for skiers. In other words, more snow makes skiing safer.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""It is too dangerous to ski on days when there was heavy snow recently.""
   - This statement suggests that heavy snow makes skiing too dangerous.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that more snow reduces danger.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that heavy snow increases danger.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. According to the Premise, more snow should make skiing safer, not more dangerous.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more they work, the more I will pay them.",My workers always work very hard.,1,"Let's analyze the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The more they work, the more I will pay them.""
   - This statement indicates a direct relationship between the amount of work done by the workers and the payment they receive. It implies that increased work results in increased pay.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""My workers always work very hard.""
   - This statement asserts that the workers consistently put in a lot of effort.

3. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise would need to imply that the workers always work very hard. However, the Premise only states a conditional relationship between work and pay, not the actual work habits of the workers.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information about the actual work habits of the workers; it only describes the payment policy based on work done.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to imply that the workers do not work hard, which it does not. The Premise is neutral regarding the actual effort of the workers.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relationship is **Neutral (1)** because the Premise does not provide sufficient information to determine the truth of the Hypothesis.

**Final Answer**: 1",**Final Answer**: 1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more they work, the more I will pay them.",I intend to compensate my workers based on their amount of work.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The more they work, the more I will pay them.""
- This statement indicates a direct relationship between the amount of work done and the payment received. It implies that payment is proportional to the amount of work.

Hypothesis: ""I intend to compensate my workers based on their amount of work.""
- This statement suggests that the speaker plans to pay workers according to the amount of work they do. It aligns with the idea that payment is related to the amount of work.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:
1. **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. If the Premise states that payment increases with more work, it directly supports the idea that compensation is based on the amount of work.
2. **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Premise did not provide enough information to confirm the Hypothesis.
3. **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Premise suggested something opposite to the Hypothesis.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis is a direct restatement of the relationship described in the Premise. Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

The correct relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more they work, the more I will pay them.",I never pay my workers.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The more they work, the more I will pay them.""
   - This statement implies a direct relationship between the amount of work done and the payment received. It suggests that payment is contingent on the amount of work performed.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I never pay my workers.""
   - This statement asserts that the speaker does not pay their workers at all, regardless of the amount of work done.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise indicates that payment is given based on the amount of work done.
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that no payment is given to the workers under any circumstances.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because the Premise explicitly states that payment is made based on work done, while the Hypothesis states that no payment is made at all.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
