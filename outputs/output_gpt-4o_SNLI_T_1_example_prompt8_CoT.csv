let-alone,substantive,"A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.",There will be peaceful negotiation of a ceasefire.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.""
   - This means that achieving a ceasefire or lasting peace will require extensive negotiation.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""There will be peaceful negotiation of a ceasefire.""
   - This suggests that the negotiation process for a ceasefire will be peaceful.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise emphasizes the length and difficulty of the negotiation process for a ceasefire or lasting peace but does not specify the nature (peaceful or otherwise) of the negotiation.
   - The Hypothesis specifically states that the negotiation will be peaceful.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not provide information about whether the negotiation will be peaceful or not. It only mentions that the negotiation will be long.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis introduces new information (the peaceful nature of the negotiation) that is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.",Negotiating lasting peace will take less time than negotiating a ceasefire.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.""
   - This implies that both a ceasefire and lasting peace require extensive negotiation, with lasting peace likely requiring even more negotiation than a ceasefire.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Negotiating lasting peace will take less time than negotiating a ceasefire.""
   - This suggests that the time required to negotiate lasting peace is shorter than the time required to negotiate a ceasefire.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates that lasting peace requires more negotiation (and thus more time) than a ceasefire.
   - The hypothesis contradicts this by suggesting that lasting peace requires less time than a ceasefire.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the premise, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.","It will take long negotiation to achieve a ceasefire, and even longer negotiation to achieve lasting peace.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the statements step by step:

### Premise:
""A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.""

### Hypothesis:
""It will take long negotiation to achieve a ceasefire, and even longer negotiation to achieve lasting peace.""

### Analysis:
1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that achieving a ceasefire will require long negotiation.
   - It also implies that achieving lasting peace will require even more negotiation than a ceasefire.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that achieving a ceasefire will require long negotiation.
   - It also states that achieving lasting peace will require even longer negotiation than a ceasefire.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis agree that a ceasefire will require long negotiation.
   - Both also agree that lasting peace will require even longer negotiation than a ceasefire.

### Conclusion:
- The hypothesis is a restatement of the premise with the same meaning.
- There is no additional information or contradiction between the two statements.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

let-alone,substantive,It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.,Both individuals and society will be consistent after difficulty.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.""
   - This suggests that achieving consistency is challenging for an individual and even more so for a society.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Both individuals and society will be consistent after difficulty.""
   - This implies that despite the difficulty, both individuals and society will eventually achieve consistency.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise emphasizes the difficulty of achieving consistency for both individuals and society, implying that it is a significant challenge.
   - The Hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that consistency will be achieved after facing difficulty.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information that guarantees individuals and society will achieve consistency after difficulty. It only highlights the challenge.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is not definitely true given the Premise. It is a possible outcome but not a certain one.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.,It is easier for a society to be consistent than an individual.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.""
   - This means that it is challenging for an individual to maintain consistency, and it implies that it is even more challenging for a society to do so.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""It is easier for a society to be consistent than an individual.""
   - This suggests that maintaining consistency is easier for a society compared to an individual.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates that consistency is difficult for an individual and even more difficult for a society.
   - The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims the opposite: that consistency is easier for a society than for an individual.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. The premise suggests that societal consistency is harder, while the hypothesis suggests it is easier.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.,It is easier for an individual to be consistent than a society.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.""
Hypothesis: ""It is easier for an individual to be consistent than a society.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The premise states that it is already challenging for an individual to maintain consistency.
   - It implies that if it is difficult for an individual, it is even more difficult for a society to be consistent.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis claims that it is easier for an individual to be consistent compared to a society.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The premise suggests that both an individual and a society find it difficult to be consistent, with the difficulty being greater for a society.
   - The hypothesis directly states that it is easier for an individual to be consistent than for a society.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The hypothesis aligns with the premise because the premise implies that an individual finds it difficult to be consistent, and a society finds it even more difficult. This means that relatively, it is easier for an individual to be consistent than for a society.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

let-alone,substantive,"I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.","I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl living in Ohio.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.""
Hypothesis: ""I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl living in Ohio.""

1. **Identify the main components of the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis express distress about ladies reading something.
   - The Premise specifies ""a girl of your tender years and experience.""
   - The Hypothesis specifies ""a girl living in Ohio.""

2. **Compare the specific details:**
   - The Premise focuses on the age and experience of the girl.
   - The Hypothesis focuses on the location (Ohio) of the girl.

3. **Determine if the Hypothesis can be true given the Premise:**
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the location of the girl.
   - The distress expressed in the Premise is about the age and experience, not the location.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis introduces a new detail (location) that is not addressed in the Premise.

4. **Evaluate the relationship:**
   - Since the Hypothesis introduces a new detail that is not contradicted or confirmed by the Premise, it is possible but not certain.
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.","I would like to hear of ladies reading anything they like, no matter the age of them.",2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

### Premise:
""I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.""

### Hypothesis:
""I would like to hear of ladies reading anything they like, no matter the age of them.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The speaker expresses distress at the idea of any ladies reading ""it"" (presumably a specific text or type of content).
   - The speaker is particularly concerned about a young girl with limited experience reading it.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker expresses a positive sentiment towards ladies reading whatever they like, regardless of their age.

3. **Comparing the Sentiments:**
   - The Premise shows a negative sentiment towards ladies (especially young girls) reading a particular content.
   - The Hypothesis shows a positive sentiment towards ladies reading anything they like, regardless of age.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The sentiments in the Premise and Hypothesis are directly opposed.
   - The Premise indicates distress and disapproval, while the Hypothesis indicates approval and encouragement.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise because the sentiments are contradictory.

### Final Relation:
2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.",I would be distressed to hear of a girl of your tender years and experience reading it.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.""
Hypothesis: ""I would be distressed to hear of a girl of your tender years and experience reading it.""

1. **Identify the key information in the Premise:**
   - The speaker would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading ""it.""
   - The speaker would be even more distressed to hear of a girl of ""your tender years and experience"" reading ""it.""

2. **Identify the key information in the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker would be distressed to hear of a girl of ""your tender years and experience"" reading ""it.""

3. **Compare the Hypothesis to the Premise:**
   - The Hypothesis is a specific case of the general statement made in the Premise.
   - The Premise explicitly states that the speaker would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading ""it,"" and even more so if it were a girl of ""your tender years and experience.""
   - The Hypothesis directly aligns with the specific case mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - Since the Hypothesis is directly supported by the information in the Premise and is a specific instance of what the Premise describes, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,"None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.",The arguments are not presented in a convincing order.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.""
   - This means that the arguments mentioned are weak and not convincing.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The arguments are not presented in a convincing order.""
   - This suggests that the order of presentation of the arguments is not convincing.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise focuses on the strength and conclusiveness of the arguments, indicating that they are weak and not conclusive.
   - The Hypothesis focuses on the order of presentation, suggesting that the arguments are not convincing due to their order.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the order of presentation of the arguments. It only comments on the strength and conclusiveness of the arguments.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not confirm or deny the order of presentation.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.",All of the given arguments are strong and conclusive.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.""
   - This means that all the arguments mentioned are weak and not conclusive.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""All of the given arguments are strong and conclusive.""
   - This means that every argument mentioned is strong and conclusive.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that none of the arguments are strong or conclusive.
   - The Hypothesis claims the exact opposite, that all the arguments are strong and conclusive.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise, it cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.",None of these arguments is conclusive.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.""
   - This statement indicates that none of the arguments being referred to are strong, and certainly none are conclusive.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""None of these arguments is conclusive.""
   - This statement asserts that none of the arguments are conclusive.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that none of the arguments are notably strong and, by extension, none are conclusive.
   - The Hypothesis states that none of the arguments are conclusive.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is a subset of the information provided in the Premise. The Premise provides additional information about the strength of the arguments, but it also clearly states that none of the arguments are conclusive.
   - Therefore, if the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must also be true.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

let-alone,substantive,"Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.",Ambiguous promises given are not to be happily accepted.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.""
   - This means that vague promises do not provide a reason for satisfaction or complacency.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Ambiguous promises given are not to be happily accepted.""
   - This means that ambiguous promises should not be accepted with happiness.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis discuss the nature of vague or ambiguous promises.
   - The Premise states that vague promises are not grounds for satisfaction or complacency.
   - The Hypothesis states that ambiguous promises should not be happily accepted.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. Both convey the idea that vague or ambiguous promises should not lead to positive feelings (satisfaction, complacency, or happiness).
   - Since the Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise in different words, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,"Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.",The speaker is more complacent than satisfied when hearing vague promises.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.""
Hypothesis: ""The speaker is more complacent than satisfied when hearing vague promises.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The premise states that vague promises do not provide any reason for satisfaction or complacency.
   - The phrase ""let alone complacency"" emphasizes that complacency is even less justified than satisfaction.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis suggests that the speaker is more complacent than satisfied when hearing vague promises.
   - This implies a comparison where complacency is present to a greater degree than satisfaction.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The premise clearly states that there is no ground for either satisfaction or complacency.
   - The hypothesis contradicts this by suggesting that the speaker experiences more complacency than satisfaction, implying that complacency is present.

4. **Determining the Relation:**
   - Since the premise explicitly denies any grounds for both satisfaction and complacency, the hypothesis, which suggests the presence of complacency, directly contradicts the premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.",The promises given are vague and the speaker will not be satisfied nor complacent.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.""
Hypothesis: ""The promises given are vague and the speaker will not be satisfied nor complacent.""

1. **Identify Key Information in the Premise:**
   - The promises are described as ""vague.""
   - These vague promises are stated to be ""no grounds for satisfaction.""
   - Additionally, they are ""no grounds for complacency.""

2. **Identify Key Information in the Hypothesis:**
   - The promises are described as ""vague.""
   - The speaker will ""not be satisfied.""
   - The speaker will ""not be complacent.""

3. **Compare the Hypothesis to the Premise:**
   - The Hypothesis states that the promises are vague, which matches the description in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker will not be satisfied, which aligns with the Premise stating that vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker will not be complacent, which aligns with the Premise stating that vague promises are no grounds for complacency.

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is directly supported by the information given in the Premise.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any uncertainty or additional conditions that would make it neutral.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

let-alone,substantive,"Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.",Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to adequately tax the aging population who would be retiring in the near future.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.""

### Hypothesis:
""Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to adequately tax the aging population who would be retiring in the near future.""

### Analysis:
1. **Content Comparison**:
   - The Premise discusses a general failure of the Government to address current and future challenges.
   - The Hypothesis specifies a particular failure related to taxing the aging population.

2. **Specificity**:
   - The Hypothesis is more specific than the Premise. It provides a particular example of a failure, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The Hypothesis could be one of the failures Mr. Brown is referring to, but it is not explicitly stated in the Premise.
   - There is no direct contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis. The Hypothesis could be true, but it is not necessarily entailed by the Premise.

### Conclusion:
Given that the Hypothesis is a specific instance that could fall under the general failures mentioned in the Premise but is not explicitly stated, the relationship is **Neutral**.

### Final Relation:

let-alone,substantive,"Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.",The Government always owns up to failures committed by them throughout the years and everyone else agrees.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.""

### Hypothesis:
""The Government always owns up to failures committed by them throughout the years and everyone else agrees.""

### Analysis:
1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Mr. Brown is making a critical statement about the Government.
   - He claims that the Government has not addressed current failures.
   - He also implies that the Government is not prepared to handle future challenges.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that the Government always acknowledges its failures.
   - It also suggests that there is a consensus (everyone else agrees) on this acknowledgment.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise suggests a negative view of the Government's handling of failures.
   - The Hypothesis suggests a positive view, stating that the Government always acknowledges its failures and that this acknowledgment is universally accepted.

### Conclusion:
- The Premise and the Hypothesis present opposing views.
- The Premise indicates that the Government does not face its failures, while the Hypothesis claims the opposite.
- Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

let-alone,substantive,"Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.",Mr. Brown stated that the Government is not prepared to face the challenges of the future.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

Premise: Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.
Hypothesis: Mr. Brown stated that the Government is not prepared to face the challenges of the future.

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - Mr. Brown is making a statement about the Government.
   - He claims that the Government has failed to address current issues (""failures of the present"").
   - He also implies that because the Government has failed to address current issues, it is even less likely to be prepared for future challenges (""let alone the challenges of the future"").

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that Mr. Brown said the Government is not prepared to face future challenges.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise explicitly mentions that the Government has failed to face current issues and implies that it is not prepared for future challenges.
   - The Hypothesis directly states that the Government is not prepared for future challenges.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Hypothesis is a direct inference from the Premise. The Premise provides a stronger statement that includes the information in the Hypothesis.
   - Therefore, if the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must also be true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

let-alone,substantive,There must have been text books around at one time but I can not even identify any titles let alone suppliers.,The speaker does not often read text books if they cannot identify any.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""There must have been text books around at one time but I can not even identify any titles let alone suppliers.""
   - This suggests that the speaker acknowledges the existence of textbooks in the past but currently cannot recall any specific titles or suppliers.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The speaker does not often read text books if they cannot identify any.""
   - This hypothesis suggests that the speaker's inability to identify any textbooks implies that they do not often read textbooks.

3. **Inference Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The hypothesis must be definitely true given the premise.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The hypothesis cannot be true given the premise.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The premise indicates that the speaker cannot identify any textbook titles or suppliers, which could imply that they do not often read textbooks. However, it does not definitively state the frequency of their reading habits. The speaker might have read textbooks in the past but simply does not remember the details now.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis is a plausible interpretation but not a definite conclusion from the premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The speaker acknowledges that textbooks existed at some point.
   - The speaker explicitly states that they cannot identify any titles of the textbooks.
   - The speaker also states that they cannot identify any suppliers of the textbooks.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The hypothesis claims that the speaker knows a lot about textbooks.
   - It specifically mentions that the speaker knows the titles of the textbooks.
   - It also mentions that the speaker knows where the textbooks might come from (suppliers).

3. **Comparing the Premise and the Hypothesis**:
   - The premise clearly states that the speaker cannot identify any titles or suppliers of the textbooks.
   - The hypothesis claims the opposite, that the speaker knows a lot about textbooks, including their titles and suppliers.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - Since the premise directly contradicts the hypothesis by stating the speaker cannot identify titles or suppliers, the hypothesis cannot be true given the premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

### Analysis:
1. **Existence of Textbooks:**
   - Premise: ""There must have been text books around at one time.""
   - Hypothesis: ""The speaker can deduce textbooks exist.""
   - The Hypothesis correctly infers that textbooks existed based on the Premise.

2. **Identification of Titles:**
   - Premise: ""I can not even identify any titles.""
   - Hypothesis: ""The speaker cannot identify any titles.""
   - The Hypothesis correctly infers that the speaker cannot identify any titles based on the Premise.

3. **Identification of Suppliers:**
   - Premise: ""Let alone suppliers.""
   - Hypothesis: ""The speaker cannot identify their suppliers.""
   - The Hypothesis correctly infers that the speaker cannot identify any suppliers based on the Premise.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis accurately reflects the information given in the Premise. Every part of the Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise.

### Premise:
""Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.""

### Hypothesis:
""I have friends who have been to other countries outside Australia.""

### Analysis:
1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that the majority of the speaker's friends have not been outside Australia.
   - The phrase ""let alone been all over the world"" emphasizes that not only have most friends not traveled outside Australia, but they certainly haven't traveled extensively.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis claims that the speaker has friends who have been to other countries outside Australia.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise does not state that *all* friends have never been outside Australia; it states that *most* have not.
   - This leaves open the possibility that some friends might have traveled outside Australia, even if they are a minority.

### Conclusion:
- The hypothesis is not definitively true based on the premise, but it is also not definitively false.
- The premise allows for the possibility that some friends could have traveled outside Australia, even though most have not.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

### Analysis:
1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that the majority of the speaker's friends have not been outside Australia.
   - It implies that very few, if any, of the speaker's friends have traveled internationally.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis claims that all of the speaker's friends have been to countries outside Australia.
   - This is a strong statement that directly contradicts the premise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise suggests that most friends have not traveled outside Australia, which means that only a minority, if any, have done so.
   - The hypothesis asserts that all friends have traveled outside Australia, which is the opposite of what the premise suggests.

### Conclusion:
The hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the premise. According to the premise, most friends have not been outside Australia, while the hypothesis claims that all friends have been outside Australia. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be true given the premise.

### Final Relation:
2 – Contradiction

So, the relation is:

let-alone,substantive,"Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.","I have a lot of friends who haven't traveled around the world, or even been outside Australia.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.""
Hypothesis: ""I have a lot of friends who haven't traveled around the world, or even been outside Australia.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The speaker states that the majority of their friends have not been outside Australia.
   - Additionally, it emphasizes that these friends have not traveled extensively (""all over the world"").

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker claims to have many friends who have not traveled around the world.
   - It also mentions that these friends have not even been outside Australia.

3. **Comparing the Statements:**
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise.
   - Both statements convey that the speaker's friends have limited travel experience, particularly not having been outside Australia or traveled extensively.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or goes beyond what is stated in the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,"As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.",She was moving forward when a knight on horseback almost ran her over.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.""
   - This indicates that a woman was moving forward cautiously (likely feeling her way because of poor visibility or some other reason), and during this time, a knight on horseback quickly passed by her.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She was moving forward when a knight on horseback almost ran her over.""
   - This suggests that while she was moving forward, a knight on horseback came very close to hitting her.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the knight ""galloped past her,"" which implies that the knight was close to her but does not explicitly state that he almost ran her over.
   - The Hypothesis adds the detail that the knight ""almost ran her over,"" which is a stronger implication of proximity and danger than simply ""galloped past her.""

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must definitively imply that the knight almost ran her over. The Premise does not provide enough detail to confirm this.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, as the knight galloping past her could imply a close call, but it is not definitively stated.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis is not directly contradicted by the Premise, as the Premise does not rule out the possibility of the knight almost running her over.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,"As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.","As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback stopped to help her along.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.""
   - This indicates that a woman is moving forward, and a knight on horseback quickly rides past her.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback stopped to help her along.""
   - This suggests that while the woman is moving forward, a knight on horseback stops to assist her.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes the knight galloping past her, which implies rapid movement and no interaction.
   - The Hypothesis describes the knight stopping to help her, which implies a pause and interaction.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are contradictory. In the Premise, the knight does not stop but instead gallops past her. In the Hypothesis, the knight stops to help her, which is the opposite of galloping past.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,"As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.","As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback went past her.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.""
   - Key points: 
     - ""As she felt her way forward"" indicates she is moving forward.
     - ""suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her"" indicates a knight on horseback went past her quickly.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback went past her.""
   - Key points:
     - ""As she was moving forward"" indicates she is moving forward.
     - ""a knight on horseback went past her"" indicates a knight on horseback went past her.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: a woman moving forward and a knight on horseback going past her.
   - The Premise includes the word ""suddenly"" and ""galloped,"" which adds a sense of speed and surprise, but these details do not change the fundamental event described.
   - The Hypothesis simplifies the description but does not contradict or add any new information that would make it uncertain.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because it describes the same event without any contradiction or uncertainty.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,If you type in the following program exactly as listed and run it you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.,A snake-like pattern might appear on your screen when you run a specific program into your personal computer.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: If you type in the following program exactly as listed and run it you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.
Hypothesis: A snake-like pattern might appear on your screen when you run a specific program into your personal computer.

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The Premise states that if a specific program is typed exactly as listed and run, a fascinating pattern that resembles a snake will appear on the screen.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The Hypothesis suggests that a snake-like pattern might appear on the screen when a specific program is run on a personal computer.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The Premise guarantees that a snake-like pattern will appear if the program is typed exactly and run.
   - The Hypothesis states that a snake-like pattern might appear, which implies a possibility rather than a certainty.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The Premise provides a definite outcome (a snake-like pattern will appear) given the condition (typing and running the program exactly as listed).
   - The Hypothesis, however, only suggests a possibility (a snake-like pattern might appear), which is less certain than the Premise.

Since the Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise but rather expresses a less certain outcome, the relationship is not one of contradiction. However, because the Hypothesis does not assert the definite outcome that the Premise guarantees, it is not an entailment either.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is Neutral.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,If you type in the following program exactly as listed and run it you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.,"Nothing shows up on your computer when you run this specific program, much less something that resembles a snake.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that if you type in a specific program exactly as listed and run it, you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.
   - This implies that the program is expected to produce a visible and specific output (a pattern resembling a snake) on the screen.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that nothing shows up on your computer when you run this specific program, much less something that resembles a snake.
   - This directly contradicts the Premise, which asserts that a specific pattern will appear.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise claims that a specific output (a snake-like pattern) will definitely appear if the program is run as described.
   - The Hypothesis claims that no output will appear, which is the opposite of what the Premise asserts.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,If you type in the following program exactly as listed and run it you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.,There's a cool snake pattern that could appear on your screen when you follow the given program and run it exactly right.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that if you type in a specific program exactly as listed and run it, you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis suggests that a cool snake pattern could appear on your screen when you follow the given program and run it exactly right.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that a fascinating pattern will snake its way across the screen if the program is typed and run exactly as listed.
   - The Hypothesis implies that a cool snake pattern could appear on the screen under the same conditions.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with slightly different wording (""cool snake pattern"" instead of ""fascinating pattern snake its way"").
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same outcome under the same conditions.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

way-manner,partial,Thus a miner who slipped from the worn and greasy rungs was liable to fall a long way and a dropped tool could clatter its way down to cause death or injury to some fellow below.,A miner has tools that are valuable and costly to replace if dropped from high above while climbing.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""Thus a miner who slipped from the worn and greasy rungs was liable to fall a long way and a dropped tool could clatter its way down to cause death or injury to some fellow below.""

### Hypothesis:
""A miner has tools that are valuable and costly to replace if dropped from high above while climbing.""

### Analysis:
1. **Content of the Premise:**
   - The premise describes a dangerous situation where a miner could fall from worn and greasy rungs.
   - It also mentions that a dropped tool could fall and cause death or injury to someone below.

2. **Content of the Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis states that a miner has tools that are valuable and costly to replace if dropped from high above while climbing.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The premise focuses on the danger of falling and the potential for a dropped tool to cause injury or death.
   - The hypothesis introduces the idea that the tools are valuable and costly to replace, which is not mentioned in the premise.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - The hypothesis introduces new information (the value and cost of the tools) that is not present in the premise.
   - The premise does not provide any information about the value or cost of the tools, only the danger they pose if dropped.

### Conclusion:
Given the premise, we cannot definitively determine whether the tools are valuable and costly to replace. The hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,Thus a miner who slipped from the worn and greasy rungs was liable to fall a long way and a dropped tool could clatter its way down to cause death or injury to some fellow below.,"A miner does not usually have tools that could ever cause injury to others, even if they were to be climbing high above someone below them and slip on a ladder.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""Thus a miner who slipped from the worn and greasy rungs was liable to fall a long way and a dropped tool could clatter its way down to cause death or injury to some fellow below.""

- **Key Points:**
  - A miner can slip from worn and greasy rungs.
  - If a miner slips, they can fall a long way.
  - A dropped tool can fall and cause death or injury to someone below.

### Hypothesis:
""A miner does not usually have tools that could ever cause injury to others, even if they were to be climbing high above someone below them and slip on a ladder.""

- **Key Points:**
  - Miners do not usually have tools that could cause injury to others.
  - This is stated as a general rule, even if they are climbing high and slip.

### Analysis:
1. **Premise vs. Hypothesis:**
   - The Premise explicitly states that a dropped tool can cause death or injury to someone below.
   - The Hypothesis claims that miners do not usually have tools that could cause injury to others, even if they slip and fall from a height.

2. **Contradiction Check:**
   - The Premise and Hypothesis are directly contradictory. The Premise asserts the potential danger of dropped tools, while the Hypothesis denies this potential danger.

3. **Entailment Check:**
   - The Hypothesis is not entailed by the Premise because the Premise suggests the opposite of what the Hypothesis claims.

4. **Neutral Check:**
   - The Hypothesis is not neutral because it directly contradicts the information given in the Premise.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is a contradiction.

**Relation: 2**",**Relation: 2**,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,Thus a miner who slipped from the worn and greasy rungs was liable to fall a long way and a dropped tool could clatter its way down to cause death or injury to some fellow below.,A miner could cause death or injury to an unsuspecting personal below them if they were to slip from worn out rungs and fall or drop a tool from their person.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information provided in both:

### Premise:
- A miner who slipped from the worn and greasy rungs was liable to fall a long way.
- A dropped tool could clatter its way down to cause death or injury to some fellow below.

### Hypothesis:
- A miner could cause death or injury to an unsuspecting person below them if they were to slip from worn out rungs and fall or drop a tool from their person.

### Analysis:
1. **Content Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis discuss the potential for a miner to cause death or injury to someone below them.
   - The Premise mentions two scenarios: a miner falling and a tool being dropped.
   - The Hypothesis combines these scenarios into a single statement, indicating that either slipping and falling or dropping a tool could cause harm.

2. **Detail Matching**:
   - The Premise specifies ""worn and greasy rungs"" and the Hypothesis mentions ""worn out rungs,"" which is a close match.
   - The Premise talks about the potential for death or injury, and the Hypothesis mirrors this by stating ""cause death or injury.""

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise. If a miner slips or drops a tool, it could indeed cause harm to someone below, as described in the Premise.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise with slightly different wording but conveys the same essential information. Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

### Final Decision:
0 – Entailment

Relation: 0",Relation: 0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,"She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.","She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension at their suggestion that she go out without a coat.",1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.""
   - This sentence describes a woman who is looking at two people (or things) and feeling a sense of apprehension that causes a physical reaction (a shiver along her spine).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension at their suggestion that she go out without a coat.""
   - This sentence also describes a woman looking at two people (or things) and feeling apprehension. However, it specifies the cause of her apprehension: a suggestion that she go out without a coat.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not specify the reason for her apprehension; it only mentions that she feels it.
   - The Hypothesis adds a specific reason for her apprehension (the suggestion to go out without a coat).

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to make the Hypothesis definitely true. In this case, the Premise does not specify the reason for her apprehension, so we cannot be certain that the Hypothesis is true based on the Premise alone.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, but it also does not provide enough information to confirm it. The reason for her apprehension could be anything, including the suggestion mentioned in the Hypothesis.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that makes the Hypothesis definitely false. In this case, the Premise does not provide any information that would make the Hypothesis false.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,"She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.","Staring from one to the other, the girl felt only confidence and strength in her body.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.""
   - This sentence describes a person (she) who is looking from one person or object to another and is feeling apprehensive, which is causing a physical reaction (a shiver along her spine).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Staring from one to the other, the girl felt only confidence and strength in her body.""
   - This sentence describes a person (the girl) who is looking from one person or object to another and is feeling confident and strong.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the person is feeling apprehensive, which is a feeling of anxiety or fear.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that the person is feeling confident and strong, which are positive emotions and the opposite of apprehension.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The feelings described in the Premise (apprehension) and the Hypothesis (confidence and strength) are contradictory.
   - Since the Hypothesis states that the girl felt only confidence and strength, it directly contradicts the Premise, which states that she felt apprehension.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,"She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.",She felt apprehension course through her body as she stared from one to the other.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.
Hypothesis: She felt apprehension course through her body as she stared from one to the other.

1. **Identify Key Elements in the Premise:**
   - Action: She stared from one to the other.
   - Feeling: Feeling apprehension.
   - Description of Feeling: Shiver its cold way along her spine.

2. **Identify Key Elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - Action: She stared from one to the other.
   - Feeling: Felt apprehension.
   - Description of Feeling: Course through her body.

3. **Compare the Actions:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action: ""She stared from one to the other.""

4. **Compare the Feelings:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the feeling of apprehension.

5. **Compare the Descriptions of the Feeling:**
   - The Premise describes the apprehension as ""shiver its cold way along her spine.""
   - The Hypothesis describes the apprehension as ""course through her body.""

6. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The descriptions of the feeling are different but convey a similar sense of apprehension affecting her physically.
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it provides a slightly different but compatible description of the same feeling.

Given that the Hypothesis is a paraphrase of the Premise and does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise, the Hypothesis can be considered definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.,We picked out all of the best songs from our favorite German operas and sang our way across the rest of Europe.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.
Hypothesis: We picked out all of the best songs from our favorite German operas and sang our way across the rest of Europe.

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - ""We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes.""
   - ""Sang our way across the rest of Europe.""

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - ""We picked out all of the best songs from our favorite German operas.""
   - ""Sang our way across the rest of Europe.""

3. **Compare the key elements:**
   - The Premise mentions ""the best songs from the tapes,"" while the Hypothesis mentions ""the best songs from our favorite German operas.""
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention ""sang our way across the rest of Europe.""

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The source of the songs is different in the Premise and the Hypothesis. The Premise specifies ""tapes,"" while the Hypothesis specifies ""German operas.""
   - The action of singing across Europe is consistent in both the Premise and the Hypothesis.

5. **Inference Analysis:**
   - The Hypothesis introduces a specific detail (""German operas"") that is not mentioned in the Premise (""tapes""). This additional detail makes the Hypothesis neither definitely true nor definitely false based on the Premise alone. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the specific source of the songs mentioned in the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.,We sat in uncomfortable silence as we travelled across the rest of Europe.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.""
   - This indicates that the subjects were actively engaging in singing while traveling across Europe.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""We sat in uncomfortable silence as we travelled across the rest of Europe.""
   - This suggests that the subjects were not engaging in any activity (specifically singing) and were instead silent and uncomfortable during their travel.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an active and enjoyable activity (singing) during travel.
   - The Hypothesis describes a passive and unpleasant experience (sitting in uncomfortable silence) during travel.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the subjects were singing, they could not have been sitting in uncomfortable silence at the same time.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

way-manner,partial,We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.,We had tapes playing the best picked songs we sang to across our trip of Europe.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.""

### Hypothesis:
""We had tapes playing the best picked songs we sang to across our trip of Europe.""

### Analysis:
1. **Content Comparison**:
   - **Premise**: The action involves picking the best songs from tapes and singing while traveling across Europe.
   - **Hypothesis**: The action involves having tapes playing the best-picked songs and singing to them during the trip across Europe.

2. **Key Elements**:
   - **Premise**: 
     - Picking the best songs from tapes.
     - Singing while traveling across Europe.
   - **Hypothesis**:
     - Having tapes playing the best-picked songs.
     - Singing to these songs during the trip across Europe.

3. **Consistency Check**:
   - The Hypothesis suggests that the tapes were playing the best-picked songs, which aligns with the Premise that the best songs were picked from tapes.
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention singing during the trip across Europe.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise with slightly different wording but essentially conveys the same meaning.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is **Entailment**.

### Premise:
""She was a big, bosomy woman who couldn't work without a box of biscuits on the desk beside her, and Sarella could hear her now, crunching her way through them.""

### Hypothesis:
""Big, bosomy women love to eat a box of biscuits near them at work, even though coworkers can hear them crunching away the whole time.""

### Analysis:
1. **Specificity vs. Generalization**:
   - The Premise describes a specific woman who needs a box of biscuits to work and is currently eating them, making noise that Sarella can hear.
   - The Hypothesis generalizes this behavior to all ""big, bosomy women,"" suggesting that they love to eat biscuits at work despite the noise.

2. **Evidence in the Premise**:
   - The Premise provides evidence about one specific woman and her behavior.
   - The Hypothesis extends this behavior to a broader group without additional evidence.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The Premise does not provide information about other women or their preferences.
   - The Hypothesis makes a broad generalization that is not supported by the specific instance in the Premise.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise only provides information about one specific woman, and it does not logically entail that all big, bosomy women have the same behavior. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

### Final Answer:

### Premise:
""She was a big, bosomy woman who couldn't work without a box of biscuits on the desk beside her, and Sarella could hear her now, crunching her way through them.""

### Hypothesis:
""She was a big, bosomy woman who could work without a box of biscuits on the desk beside her, and Sarella could hear how quiet it was without her crunching through them.""

### Analysis:
1. **Subject Consistency**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis refer to the same woman described as ""big"" and ""bosomy.""

2. **Key Action/Condition**:
   - **Premise**: The woman ""couldn't work without a box of biscuits on the desk beside her"" and is currently ""crunching her way through them.""
   - **Hypothesis**: The woman ""could work without a box of biscuits on the desk beside her"" and it is ""quiet without her crunching through them.""

3. **Contradiction Check**:
   - The Premise states that the woman cannot work without biscuits and is currently eating them.
   - The Hypothesis states the opposite: that she can work without biscuits and it is quiet because she is not eating them.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise asserts that the woman needs biscuits to work and is currently eating them, while the Hypothesis asserts that she does not need biscuits to work and is not eating them.

### Final Relation:
2 – Contradiction

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The subject is a ""big, bosomy woman.""
   - She has a habit of keeping a box of biscuits on her desk.
   - She cannot work without this box of biscuits.
   - Sarella can hear her crunching through the biscuits.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Sarella can hear a ""big, bosomy woman"" crunching her way through a box of biscuits.
   - The box of biscuits is on her desk.
   - She cannot work without this box of biscuits.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same woman.
   - Both mention the box of biscuits on her desk.
   - Both state that she cannot work without the box of biscuits.
   - Both indicate that Sarella can hear her crunching through the biscuits.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise with no additional or contradictory information.
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.,A man who was no longer young moved carefully into a particular room.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""A middle-aged man"" indicates a man who is not young but not old, typically between the ages of 40 and 60.
   - ""eased his way into the room"" suggests that the man entered the room carefully or gently.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""A man who was no longer young"" aligns with the description of a middle-aged man.
   - ""moved carefully into a particular room"" aligns with the description of easing his way into the room.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a man who is not young.
   - Both describe the man entering a room carefully.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis restates the information in the Premise using different words but maintains the same meaning, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.,A middle-aged man could not get into the room.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.
Hypothesis: A middle-aged man could not get into the room.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that a middle-aged man successfully entered the room, and he did so in a manner that suggests it was done with some ease or without much difficulty.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that a middle-aged man was unable to enter the room. This implies that the man did not succeed in getting into the room.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise indicates successful entry into the room.
   - The Hypothesis indicates failure to enter the room.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - If the Premise is true (the man eased his way into the room), then the Hypothesis (the man could not get into the room) cannot be true.
   - These two statements are directly contradictory because one states successful entry and the other states failure to enter.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.,A man of maybe fifty years moved carefully into the room.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.""
   - Key points: 
     - The subject is a ""middle-aged man.""
     - The action is ""eased his way into the room,"" which implies careful or gentle movement.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""A man of maybe fifty years moved carefully into the room.""
   - Key points:
     - The subject is ""a man of maybe fifty years,"" which is consistent with being middle-aged.
     - The action is ""moved carefully into the room,"" which is similar to ""eased his way into the room.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The subject in both the Premise and the Hypothesis is a middle-aged man, which is consistent.
   - The action described in both sentences involves careful movement into the room, which is also consistent.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise with synonymous terms (""middle-aged"" vs. ""maybe fifty years"" and ""eased"" vs. ""moved carefully"").

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.,I yawned three times on my journey to the Narrow Neck.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.""
   - This implies that the speaker yawned multiple times during their journey to the Narrow Neck.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I yawned three times on my journey to the Narrow Neck.""
   - This specifies a particular number of yawns (three) during the journey to the Narrow Neck.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates yawning occurred but does not specify the number of yawns.
   - The Hypothesis specifies the exact number of yawns (three).

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true, the Premise would need to specify that exactly three yawns occurred. Since the Premise does not specify the number of yawns, we cannot be certain that the Hypothesis is definitely true.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise allows for the possibility of yawning three times, but it does not confirm it.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise explicitly stated a different number of yawns or no yawns at all. Since the Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, this is not the case.

Given the analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.,I was energized on my way back to Narrow Neck.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.""
   - The phrase ""yawned my way"" suggests that the speaker was tired or sleepy while returning to the Narrow Neck.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I was energized on my way back to Narrow Neck.""
   - The phrase ""was energized"" suggests that the speaker was full of energy or not tired while returning to the Narrow Neck.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a state of tiredness or sleepiness.
   - The Hypothesis indicates a state of being energized, which is the opposite of being tired or sleepy.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise suggests tiredness and the Hypothesis suggests being energized, these two states are contradictory.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.,I yawned at least once on my journey back to the Narrow Neck.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker yawned multiple times during their journey back to the Narrow Neck.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I yawned at least once on my journey back to the Narrow Neck.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker yawned at least one time during their journey back to the Narrow Neck.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker yawned multiple times during the journey.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker yawned at least once during the journey.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the speaker yawned multiple times (as stated in the Premise), it logically follows that they yawned at least once (as stated in the Hypothesis).

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.,I bought my flight ticket with ease onto the same flight as other passengers.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.
Hypothesis: I bought my flight ticket with ease onto the same flight as other passengers.

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The Premise states that it was easy to buy a ticket for the same flight.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker bought their flight ticket with ease and it was for the same flight as other passengers.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The Premise indicates ease in buying a ticket for the same flight.
   - The Hypothesis elaborates on this by stating that the speaker indeed bought the ticket with ease and specifies that it was for the same flight as other passengers.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is a more detailed restatement of the Premise. It does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise, as the ease of buying a ticket implies that the speaker could indeed buy the ticket.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.,It was a hard feat to buy my way onto the same flight.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.""
   - This statement indicates that the action of buying a ticket for the same flight was simple and not difficult.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""It was a hard feat to buy my way onto the same flight.""
   - This statement suggests that the action of buying a ticket for the same flight was challenging and difficult.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that buying the ticket was easy.
   - The Hypothesis states that buying the ticket was hard.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis present directly opposing descriptions of the same action (buying a ticket for the same flight).
   - If something is described as easy in the Premise, it cannot simultaneously be described as hard in the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.,It came easily for me to buy a ticket on the same flight.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.""
Hypothesis: ""It came easily for me to buy a ticket on the same flight.""

1. **Paraphrasing the Premise**: The Premise states that it was easy to secure a spot on the same flight.
2. **Paraphrasing the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that it was easy to buy a ticket for the same flight.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the idea that obtaining a place on the same flight was easy.
   - The Premise uses the phrase ""buy my way on to the same flight,"" which implies purchasing a ticket.
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states ""buy a ticket on the same flight,"" which is a direct and clear way of expressing the same idea.

4. **Checking for Consistency**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise with the same meaning.

Given that the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the information provided in the Premise, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.,Constance was looking for first-class carriages to take a ride on.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.""
   - This indicates that Constance is actively searching for first-class carriages on a platform, which is typically associated with a train station.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Constance was looking for first-class carriages to take a ride on.""
   - This suggests that Constance's purpose for looking for the first-class carriages is to take a ride on them.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Constance is looking for first-class carriages.
   - The Hypothesis adds a specific reason for this action: to take a ride on them.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state why Constance is looking for the first-class carriages, only that she is looking for them.
   - The Hypothesis provides a possible reason for her search, but this reason is not confirmed by the Premise.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.,Constance waited in line for the first-class carriages.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.""
   - This indicates that Constance is actively moving along the platform with the intention of finding the first-class carriages.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Constance waited in line for the first-class carriages.""
   - This suggests that Constance is standing in a queue, waiting for the first-class carriages.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes Constance moving along the platform, while the Hypothesis describes her standing in line.
   - These two actions are different: moving along the platform vs. standing in line.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise explicitly stated that Constance was waiting in line.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny that Constance eventually waited in line.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise explicitly stated that Constance did not wait in line.

Given that the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the action of waiting in line, the relationship is Neutral.

**Final Decision**: 1",**Final Decision**: 1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.,Constance was looking for first-class carriages as she squeezed her way down to the platform.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.""
   - This sentence tells us that Constance is on a platform and is actively searching for first-class carriages while moving down the platform.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Constance was looking for first-class carriages as she squeezed her way down to the platform.""
   - This sentence suggests that Constance is looking for first-class carriages while moving down to the platform.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention Constance looking for first-class carriages.
   - The Premise specifies that she is moving down the platform, while the Hypothesis suggests she is moving down to the platform.
   - The difference in prepositions (""down the platform"" vs. ""down to the platform"") could imply different actions, but the core activity of looking for first-class carriages remains consistent.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it is plausible that Constance could be looking for first-class carriages while moving down to the platform.
   - However, the Hypothesis does not necessarily follow directly from the Premise because the exact movement described is slightly different.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise, making the relationship **Neutral**.

Final Relation Output: 1",Final Relation Output: 1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.,The practical man thought about the obstacles to his finding an affordable home.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.""
   - This statement indicates that a practical man is thinking and finding solutions to some obstacles. The nature of these obstacles is not specified.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The practical man thought about the obstacles to his finding an affordable home.""
   - This statement specifies that the obstacles are related to finding an affordable home.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions ""apparent obstacles"" without specifying what they are.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that the obstacles are related to finding an affordable home.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis introduces a specific context (finding an affordable home) that is not mentioned in the Premise.
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny that the obstacles are related to finding an affordable home.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. There is no direct contradiction, nor is there a definite entailment.

Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.,The careless man did not have to think about his easy going life.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.
Hypothesis: The careless man did not have to think about his easy going life.

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - Subject: The practical man
   - Action: Thought his way through
   - Object: These apparent obstacles

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - Subject: The careless man
   - Action: Did not have to think about
   - Object: His easy going life

3. **Compare the subjects:**
   - The Premise talks about a ""practical man,"" while the Hypothesis talks about a ""careless man."" These are two different subjects with contrasting characteristics.

4. **Compare the actions:**
   - In the Premise, the practical man is actively thinking to overcome obstacles.
   - In the Hypothesis, the careless man is not thinking and is described as having an easy-going life.

5. **Compare the objects:**
   - The Premise mentions ""apparent obstacles,"" indicating challenges.
   - The Hypothesis mentions ""easy going life,"" indicating a lack of challenges.

6. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Premise and Hypothesis describe two different individuals with opposite characteristics and situations.
   - The practical man facing obstacles and thinking through them is in direct contrast to the careless man not thinking and having an easy-going life.

Given these points, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise because they describe fundamentally different scenarios and characteristics.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.,The practical man had obstacles he could think his way through.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.
Hypothesis: The practical man had obstacles he could think his way through.

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - Subject: The practical man
   - Action: thought his way through
   - Object: these apparent obstacles

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - Subject: The practical man
   - Action: had obstacles he could think his way through

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis talk about a practical man dealing with obstacles.
   - The Premise states that the practical man ""thought his way through these apparent obstacles,"" which implies that he had obstacles and successfully navigated through them using his thinking.
   - The Hypothesis states that the practical man ""had obstacles he could think his way through,"" which implies that he had obstacles and it was possible for him to navigate through them using his thinking.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. The Premise confirms that the practical man did think his way through the obstacles, and the Hypothesis states that he had obstacles he could think his way through.
   - Since the Premise confirms the possibility stated in the Hypothesis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1. **Identify the key information in the Premise:**
   - The research was made possible by grants from three specific sources: Wenner-Gren Foundation, Institute of Turkish Studies, and Sachar Fund of Brandeis University.

2. **Identify the key information in the Hypothesis:**
   - The research was made possible by ""record-breakingly enormous"" grants from the same three sources.

3. **Compare the information:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree on the sources of the grants.
   - The Hypothesis adds a qualitative description (""record-breakingly enormous"") to the grants, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the size or record-breaking nature of the grants. Therefore, the Hypothesis introduces new information that is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.

resultative,schematic,The Court 's apparent detachment from politics is MADE possible by its nonelective status .,The Court 's apparent detachment from politics is clear from the stately décor of the courtroom.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The Court's apparent detachment from politics is MADE possible by its nonelective status.""
   - This means that the Court's detachment from politics is attributed to the fact that its members are not elected.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The Court's apparent detachment from politics is clear from the stately décor of the courtroom.""
   - This suggests that the detachment from politics is evident from the appearance or decoration of the courtroom.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis are discussing the Court's detachment from politics but attribute it to different reasons.
   - The Premise attributes the detachment to the nonelective status of the Court.
   - The Hypothesis attributes the detachment to the stately décor of the courtroom.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be entailed by the Premise, the Premise must provide sufficient information to make the Hypothesis definitely true. In this case, the Premise does not mention anything about the courtroom's décor, so it cannot entail the Hypothesis.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide information about the courtroom's décor, so it is possible that the décor could indicate detachment from politics, but it is not certain.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be contradicted by the Premise, the Premise must provide information that makes the Hypothesis definitely false. In this case, the Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis; it simply does not address the décor.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

resultative,schematic,The Court 's apparent detachment from politics is MADE possible by its nonelective status .,The Court 's apparent attachment to politics is made possible by its elective status .,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The Court's apparent detachment from politics is MADE possible by its nonelective status.
Hypothesis: The Court's apparent attachment to politics is made possible by its elective status.

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - Premise: ""detachment from politics,"" ""nonelective status""
   - Hypothesis: ""attachment to politics,"" ""elective status""

2. **Compare Key Elements:**
   - The Premise states that the Court is detached from politics because it is nonelective.
   - The Hypothesis states the opposite: the Court is attached to politics because it is elective.

3. **Determine Relationship:**
   - The Premise and Hypothesis present opposite scenarios regarding the Court's relationship to politics and its status (nonelective vs. elective).
   - The Premise suggests a detachment due to being nonelective, while the Hypothesis suggests an attachment due to being elective.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the Premise is true, the Hypothesis cannot be true, and vice versa.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Hypothesis: The Court has a nonelective status that makes their apparent detachment from politics possible.

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - **Premise**: The statement asserts that the Court's detachment from politics is enabled by its nonelective status.
   - **Hypothesis**: The statement asserts that the Court's nonelective status enables its detachment from politics.

2. **Paraphrasing**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. Both statements convey the same idea: the Court's detachment from politics is due to its nonelective status.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis that is not present in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not suggest anything that would make the Premise false.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise and does not introduce any new or contradictory information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny that Justin Timberlake sings a hit song.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise explicitly stated that Justin Timberlake does not sing in the rom-com.

Since the Premise does not provide information about whether Justin Timberlake sings a hit song, the Hypothesis cannot be confirmed or denied based on the given Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Justin Timberlake MAKES Alcoholism Fun In The New Rom-Com The Last Drop,Justin Timberlake does not make alcoholism look fun in the old rom-com The Last Drop.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""Justin Timberlake MAKES Alcoholism Fun In The New Rom-Com The Last Drop""

### Hypothesis:
""Justin Timberlake does not make alcoholism look fun in the old rom-com The Last Drop.""

### Analysis:
1. **Content Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Justin Timberlake makes alcoholism fun in a new rom-com titled ""The Last Drop.""
   - The Hypothesis states that Justin Timberlake does not make alcoholism look fun in an old rom-com titled ""The Last Drop.""

2. **Key Differences**:
   - **Fun vs. Not Fun**: The Premise says he makes alcoholism fun, while the Hypothesis says he does not make it look fun. This is a direct contradiction.
   - **New vs. Old**: The Premise mentions a new rom-com, while the Hypothesis mentions an old rom-com. This could imply a different context or time frame, but the main contradiction lies in the portrayal of alcoholism.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise on the portrayal of alcoholism (fun vs. not fun).
   - The difference in the time frame (new vs. old) adds to the contradiction but is secondary to the main point of contention.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise because it directly contradicts the portrayal of alcoholism.

### Final Relation Output:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Justin Timberlake MAKES Alcoholism Fun In The New Rom-Com The Last Drop,Justin Timberlake is in a new rom-com called The Last Drop where he makes alcoholism interesting.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Justin Timberlake MAKES Alcoholism Fun In The New Rom-Com The Last Drop""
   - This statement indicates that Justin Timberlake is involved in a new romantic comedy (rom-com) titled ""The Last Drop"" and that the theme of the movie involves making alcoholism appear fun.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Justin Timberlake is in a new rom-com called The Last Drop where he makes alcoholism interesting.""
   - This statement suggests that Justin Timberlake is in a new romantic comedy titled ""The Last Drop"" and that he makes alcoholism appear interesting.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention Justin Timberlake being in a new rom-com called ""The Last Drop.""
   - The Premise states that he makes alcoholism ""fun,"" while the Hypothesis states that he makes alcoholism ""interesting.""

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The terms ""fun"" and ""interesting"" are not identical but are closely related in this context. Both imply a positive or engaging portrayal of alcoholism, though ""fun"" is a bit more specific than ""interesting.""
   - Given the context, the Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise. Instead, it provides a slightly different but compatible interpretation of the same idea.

Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as the exact nature of how alcoholism is portrayed (fun vs. interesting) is not definitively clear from the Premise alone.

**Final Decision**:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.,This nice man has a mother who will kiss him to the point of unconsciousness.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.""
   - The key elements here are:
     - ""This nice man"" refers to a specific individual.
     - ""probably just wanted"" indicates a desire or intention, not a certainty.
     - ""Mother to KISS him unconscious"" suggests an action that the man desires from ""Mother"" (capitalized, which might imply a specific person or entity).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""This nice man has a mother who will kiss him to the point of unconsciousness.""
   - The key elements here are:
     - ""This nice man"" refers to the same individual as in the premise.
     - ""has a mother"" implies a familial relationship.
     - ""who will kiss him to the point of unconsciousness"" suggests a certainty that the mother will perform this action.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates a desire or intention (""probably just wanted"") for ""Mother"" to kiss him unconscious, but it does not confirm that this will happen or that ""Mother"" is indeed his mother.
   - The hypothesis asserts a certainty (""has a mother who will"") that the mother will kiss him to the point of unconsciousness.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis makes a definitive statement about the relationship and the action, which is not confirmed by the premise. The premise only suggests a desire, not a certainty.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the hypothesis.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.,This bad man has a mother that he never wants to lay a kiss on him.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.""
Hypothesis: ""This bad man has a mother that he never wants to lay a kiss on him.""

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - ""This nice man"" suggests a positive characterization of the man.
   - ""probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious"" implies a desire for a kiss from Mother, albeit in a hyperbolic or exaggerated manner.

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - ""This bad man"" suggests a negative characterization of the man, which is in direct contrast to the ""nice man"" in the Premise.
   - ""has a mother that he never wants to lay a kiss on him"" implies a complete aversion to being kissed by his mother, which is the opposite of the desire expressed in the Premise.

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - The Premise describes a man who is characterized as ""nice"" and who desires a kiss from his mother.
   - The Hypothesis describes a man who is characterized as ""bad"" and who does not want a kiss from his mother.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The characterizations of the man in the Premise and Hypothesis are contradictory (""nice"" vs. ""bad"").
   - The desires regarding the kiss are also contradictory (wants a kiss vs. does not want a kiss).

Given these points, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise in both the characterization of the man and his desires regarding a kiss from his mother.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.,"This nice man probably just wanted Mother to kiss him, causing him to be unconscious.",0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the steps:

1. **Understand the Premise:**
   - ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.""
   - The key elements here are:
     - A nice man
     - His desire for Mother to kiss him
     - The result of the kiss being that he becomes unconscious

2. **Understand the Hypothesis:**
   - ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to kiss him, causing him to be unconscious.""
   - The key elements here are:
     - A nice man
     - His desire for Mother to kiss him
     - The result of the kiss being that he becomes unconscious

3. **Compare the Elements:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same scenario: a nice man wanting Mother to kiss him, with the result being that he becomes unconscious.
   - The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is the same.

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they describe the same situation with no additional or contradictory information), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.,I had brushed my hair until it felt soft.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.""
   - This indicates that the speaker brushed their hair to the point where it became smooth.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I had brushed my hair until it felt soft.""
   - This suggests that the speaker brushed their hair until it felt soft to the touch.

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Smooth vs. Soft**: The terms ""smooth"" and ""soft"" are not synonymous. ""Smooth"" refers to the texture being even and without tangles, while ""soft"" refers to the texture being gentle and not coarse.
   - **Brushing Action**: Both statements involve the action of brushing hair, but the outcomes described are different.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not necessarily imply that the hair felt soft; it only states that the hair was smooth.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a different outcome (softness) that is not directly supported or contradicted by the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the Hypothesis.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.,I had brushed my nonexistent hair roughly.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.
Hypothesis: I had brushed my nonexistent hair roughly.

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - The action: ""I had BRUSHED my hair""
   - The result: ""very smooth""

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - The action: ""I had brushed my nonexistent hair""
   - The manner: ""roughly""

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - The Premise states that the speaker brushed their hair and made it smooth.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker brushed their ""nonexistent hair"" and did so roughly.

4. **Evaluate the consistency:**
   - The Premise implies that the speaker has hair because they brushed it smooth.
   - The Hypothesis contradicts this by stating the hair is ""nonexistent,"" which means there is no hair to brush.
   - Additionally, the manner of brushing (""roughly"") contradicts the result in the Premise (""very smooth"").

Given these points, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise because it states that the hair is nonexistent and brushed roughly, which is incompatible with the Premise that the hair was brushed smooth.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.,I had very smooth hair because I brushed it.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.""
   - This indicates that the action of brushing the hair resulted in it being very smooth.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I had very smooth hair because I brushed it.""
   - This suggests that the reason for having very smooth hair is the act of brushing it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise directly states that the hair was brushed very smooth, implying that the smoothness is a result of brushing.
   - The Hypothesis states the same cause-and-effect relationship: the hair is smooth because it was brushed.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because the Premise explicitly states the action (brushing) and its result (smooth hair).
   - There is a clear entailment relationship here, as the Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,You KILLED it stone-dead.,You killed someone.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The phrase ""You KILLED it stone-dead"" is an idiomatic expression.
   - In common usage, this phrase typically means that someone did something exceptionally well or effectively, not that they literally killed something or someone.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The phrase ""You killed someone"" is a literal statement indicating that a person has been killed.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise uses an idiomatic expression that does not imply a literal killing.
   - The Hypothesis interprets the action as a literal killing of a person.

4. **Inference**:
   - Given the idiomatic nature of the Premise, it does not support the literal interpretation of the Hypothesis.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,You KILLED it stone-dead.,You caused it to be more alive.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""You KILLED it stone-dead.""
Hypothesis: ""You caused it to be more alive.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The phrase ""You KILLED it stone-dead"" implies that something was completely destroyed or rendered lifeless. The use of ""stone-dead"" emphasizes the totality of the action, leaving no room for any form of life or activity.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The phrase ""You caused it to be more alive"" suggests that the action resulted in an increase in life or activity. This is the direct opposite of being killed or rendered lifeless.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The Premise indicates a complete cessation of life or activity.
   - The Hypothesis indicates an increase in life or activity.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The Premise and Hypothesis present directly opposing outcomes. If something is killed stone-dead, it cannot simultaneously be more alive. Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,You KILLED it stone-dead.,It was stone-dead as a result of you killing it.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""You KILLED it stone-dead.""
   - This statement indicates that an action (killing) was performed by ""you"" and the result was that ""it"" became ""stone-dead.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""It was stone-dead as a result of you killing it.""
   - This statement suggests that ""it"" was ""stone-dead"" and attributes the cause of this state to the action of ""you"" killing it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis directly restates the result of the action described in the Premise.
   - The Premise states that ""you"" killed ""it"" and the result was ""stone-dead.""
   - The Hypothesis states that ""it"" was ""stone-dead"" because ""you"" killed it.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because it accurately reflects the cause-and-effect relationship described in the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The tools were WIPED clean.,The tools were cleaned with a cloth.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The tools were WIPED clean.""
   - This statement indicates that the tools were cleaned by wiping them. The method of cleaning is specified as ""wiping.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""The tools were cleaned with a cloth.""
   - This statement suggests that the tools were cleaned using a cloth. The method of cleaning involves a cloth.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the tools were wiped clean, which generally implies the use of a cloth or similar material to perform the wiping action.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that a cloth was used to clean the tools.

4. **Inference**:
   - The action of wiping typically involves using a cloth or something similar. Therefore, if the tools were wiped clean, it is reasonable to infer that a cloth could have been used.
   - There is no contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis. Instead, the Hypothesis provides a plausible method for the action described in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, as wiping clean usually involves using a cloth.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The tools were WIPED clean.,The tools were extremely dirty.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The tools were WIPED clean.""
   - This statement indicates that the tools were cleaned, implying they are now in a clean state.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The tools were extremely dirty.""
   - This statement indicates that the tools are in a very dirty state.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the tools are clean.
   - The Hypothesis states that the tools are extremely dirty.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the tools are clean (as per the Premise), they cannot be extremely dirty (as per the Hypothesis).
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final output:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The tools were WIPED clean.,The tools were clean because they were wiped.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The tools were WIPED clean.""
   - This statement indicates that the tools were cleaned by wiping them.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The tools were clean because they were wiped.""
   - This statement suggests that the reason the tools are clean is that they were wiped.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

- **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.
  - If the tools were wiped clean, it logically follows that they are clean because they were wiped. The Hypothesis directly follows from the Premise.

- **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.
  - This would be the case if the Premise did not provide enough information to confirm the Hypothesis. However, in this case, the Premise clearly states that the tools were wiped clean, which supports the Hypothesis.

- **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.
  - This would be the case if the Premise and Hypothesis were in direct conflict. However, there is no conflict here; the Hypothesis is supported by the Premise.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The river FROZE solid.,The river was cold.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The river FROZE solid.
Hypothesis: The river was cold.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The statement ""The river FROZE solid"" indicates that the temperature of the river dropped to the point where the water turned into ice. This implies extremely cold conditions.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The statement ""The river was cold"" suggests that the temperature of the river was low, but it does not specify how low.

3. **Checking for Entailment**: If the river froze solid, it must have been cold. Freezing is a specific condition that occurs when the temperature is at or below the freezing point of water (0°C or 32°F). Therefore, if the river froze solid, it is definitely true that the river was cold.

4. **Checking for Neutrality**: The hypothesis ""The river was cold"" is a less specific statement than the premise. While the premise provides a specific condition (freezing), the hypothesis only states a general condition (cold). However, the general condition is inherently true if the specific condition is true.

5. **Checking for Contradiction**: There is no contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise supports the hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The river FROZE solid.,The river had melted into liquid.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The river FROZE solid.""
   - This statement indicates that the river is in a solid state due to freezing.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""The river had melted into liquid.""
   - This statement indicates that the river is in a liquid state due to melting.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the river is solid (frozen).
   - The Hypothesis states that the river is liquid (melted).

4. **Inference**:
   - A river cannot be both solid (frozen) and liquid (melted) at the same time. These two states are mutually exclusive.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The river FROZE solid.,The river is frozen solid.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The river FROZE solid.""
   - This statement indicates that at some point in time, the river underwent the process of freezing and is now in a solid state.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The river is frozen solid.""
   - This statement indicates the current state of the river, which is that it is in a solid, frozen state.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the river ""froze solid,"" which implies that the river is currently in a frozen solid state.
   - The Hypothesis states that the river ""is frozen solid,"" which directly describes the current state of the river.

4. **Inference**:
   - Given that the Premise indicates the river has frozen solid, it logically follows that the river is currently in a frozen solid state.
   - There is no additional information or context needed to confirm the Hypothesis based on the Premise.

Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Relation: 0",Relation: 0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,It BROKE apart.,It broke into pieces by hand.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""It BROKE apart.""
   - This statement indicates that something has broken into separate parts. It does not specify how the breaking occurred, only that the breaking happened.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""It broke into pieces by hand.""
   - This statement specifies that the breaking into pieces was done manually, by hand.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that something broke apart, but it does not provide any information about the method or cause of the breaking.
   - The Hypothesis adds additional information by specifying that the breaking was done by hand.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must imply that the breaking was done by hand. Since the Premise does not specify how the breaking occurred, it does not entail the Hypothesis.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it is not necessarily true. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the method of breaking.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to imply that the breaking was not done by hand. Since the Premise does not provide any information about the method of breaking, it does not contradict the Hypothesis.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,It BROKE apart.,It was put together.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""It BROKE apart.""
   - This indicates that something was in a state of disintegration or separation.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""It was put together.""
   - This suggests that something was in a state of being assembled or united.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a state of disintegration (""broke apart"").
   - The Hypothesis indicates a state of assembly (""put together"").

4. **Inference**:
   - The state described in the Premise (""broke apart"") directly contradicts the state described in the Hypothesis (""put together"").
   - If something is broken apart, it cannot simultaneously be put together.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the appropriate numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,It BROKE apart.,It was severed into more than one piece.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: It BROKE apart.
Hypothesis: It was severed into more than one piece.

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The phrase ""It BROKE apart"" indicates that something has been divided or split into separate parts.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The phrase ""It was severed into more than one piece"" suggests that something has been cut or split into multiple pieces.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a situation where something is divided into multiple parts.
   - The term ""broke apart"" in the Premise is synonymous with ""severed into more than one piece"" in the Hypothesis.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - Given that the Hypothesis directly describes the state of being divided into multiple pieces, which is consistent with the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,He HAMMERED the metal flat.,He was making a sword by hammering metal.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He HAMMERED the metal flat.""
   - This statement indicates that someone is using a hammer to flatten a piece of metal. It does not provide any additional context about the purpose or the final product.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He was making a sword by hammering metal.""
   - This statement suggests that the person is engaged in the process of making a sword, which involves hammering metal.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise only states that the metal was hammered flat. It does not specify what the metal is being used for or what the final product will be.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a specific purpose (making a sword) that is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true, the Premise must provide enough information to confirm that the person is making a sword. The Premise does not provide this information.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not rule out the possibility that the person is making a sword, but it also does not confirm it.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false, the Premise would need to provide information that directly contradicts the idea of making a sword. The Premise does not do this.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,He HAMMERED the metal flat.,He enflated the metal into a balloon.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The action described is ""He HAMMERED the metal flat.""
   - This implies that the metal was subjected to force to make it flat, indicating a physical transformation where the metal becomes flat due to hammering.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The action described is ""He enflated the metal into a balloon.""
   - This implies that the metal was somehow expanded or filled with air to take the shape of a balloon, which is a completely different transformation from being hammered flat.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a flattening process, while the Hypothesis describes an inflation process.
   - These two processes are mutually exclusive; if the metal is hammered flat, it cannot simultaneously be inflated into a balloon.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true because the physical states described (flat vs. balloon) are contradictory.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,He HAMMERED the metal flat.,He flattened the metal by hammering.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: He HAMMERED the metal flat.
Hypothesis: He flattened the metal by hammering.

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The action described is ""hammered.""
   - The object of the action is ""the metal.""
   - The result of the action is ""flat.""

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The action described is ""flattened.""
   - The method of the action is ""by hammering.""
   - The object of the action is ""the metal.""

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action (hammering) and the same result (flattening the metal).
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise in different words.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment

The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The dog BARKED the chickens awake.""
   - This statement indicates that the dog barked, and as a result, the chickens woke up.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The dog likes to wake the chickens up by barking.""
   - This statement suggests that the dog has a preference or habit of waking the chickens by barking.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides a specific instance where the dog barked and woke the chickens.
   - The Hypothesis generalizes this instance to suggest that the dog enjoys or habitually wakes the chickens by barking.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise provided evidence that the dog always or habitually barks to wake the chickens.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise describes a single event, but it does not provide enough information to conclude that the dog likes or habitually wakes the chickens by barking.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise indicated that the dog does not like to wake the chickens by barking or if it was a one-time event with no indication of preference.

Given that the Premise describes a single event and does not provide enough information to conclude the dog's preferences or habits, the relationship is **Neutral**.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,The dog BARKED the chickens awake.,The dog was silent because there were chickens.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The dog BARKED the chickens awake.""
   - This statement indicates that the dog made a loud noise (barked) which caused the chickens to wake up.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The dog was silent because there were chickens.""
   - This statement suggests that the dog did not make any noise (was silent) due to the presence of chickens.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that the dog barked, which is a direct action that caused the chickens to wake up.
   - The Hypothesis states that the dog was silent, which directly contradicts the action described in the Premise.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the Hypothesis claims the dog was silent and the Premise claims the dog barked, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final output:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The dog BARKED the chickens awake.,The chickens woke to the dog's bark.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The dog BARKED the chickens awake.
Hypothesis: The chickens woke to the dog's bark.

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The premise states that the dog barked, and as a result, the chickens woke up. The barking of the dog is the cause, and the waking of the chickens is the effect.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis states that the chickens woke up because of the dog's bark. This implies that the barking of the dog caused the chickens to wake up.

3. **Comparing the Premise and the Hypothesis:**
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis describe the same cause-and-effect relationship: the dog's bark caused the chickens to wake up.
   - There is no additional information in the hypothesis that contradicts or adds uncertainty to the premise.

4. **Determining the Relation:**
   - Since the hypothesis is a restatement of the premise and directly follows from it, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,Terry WIPED the table clean.,Terry had cleaned the table to eat.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Terry WIPED the table clean.""
   - This means that Terry performed an action to make the table clean by wiping it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Terry had cleaned the table to eat.""
   - This suggests that Terry cleaned the table with the intention of eating.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise confirms that Terry wiped the table clean, which implies that the table is now clean.
   - The Hypothesis adds an additional detail about the purpose of cleaning the table, which is to eat.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it is possible that Terry cleaned the table to eat.
   - However, the Premise does not explicitly state the reason for cleaning the table, so we cannot be certain that the reason was to eat.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Terry WIPED the table clean.,Terry wiped the table with a greasy rag until it was black.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: Terry WIPED the table clean.
   - This statement indicates that Terry performed an action (wiping) on the table, resulting in the table being clean.

2. **Hypothesis**: Terry wiped the table with a greasy rag until it was black.
   - This statement suggests that Terry used a greasy rag to wipe the table, and the action resulted in the table becoming black.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the table was wiped clean, implying that the table ended up in a clean state.
   - The Hypothesis states that the table was wiped with a greasy rag until it was black, implying that the table ended up in a dirty or blackened state.

4. **Inference**:
   - The two statements describe opposite outcomes for the state of the table after wiping. The Premise indicates a clean table, while the Hypothesis indicates a dirty or blackened table.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because the outcomes are contradictory.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Terry WIPED the table clean.,The table was clean because Terry wiped it down.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: Terry WIPED the table clean.
   - This statement indicates that Terry performed an action (wiping) that resulted in the table being clean.

2. **Hypothesis**: The table was clean because Terry wiped it down.
   - This statement suggests that the table's cleanliness is a direct result of Terry's action of wiping it down.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

- **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. If Terry wiped the table clean, it logically follows that the table was clean because Terry wiped it down. The Hypothesis is a restatement of the result implied by the Premise.
- **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Premise did not provide enough information to confirm the Hypothesis.
- **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Hypothesis directly contradicted the information in the Premise.

Given that the Premise explicitly states that Terry wiped the table clean, it directly supports the Hypothesis that the table was clean because of Terry's action. Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

The correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,Terry PUSHED the door shut.,Terry closed the door with his side.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Terry PUSHED the door shut.""
   - This indicates that Terry used some form of force to close the door, specifically by pushing it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Terry closed the door with his side.""
   - This suggests that Terry used his side (part of his body) to close the door.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise specifies the action of pushing the door shut but does not specify which part of the body was used.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that Terry used his side to close the door, which is a specific way of pushing.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise would need to specify that Terry used his side to push the door shut. Since the Premise only mentions pushing, it does not entail the specific method described in the Hypothesis.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny that Terry used his side to push the door shut. It is possible that Terry used his side, but it is also possible that he used his hand or another part of his body.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to specify a different method of pushing that contradicts using the side. Since the Premise does not specify the method, there is no direct contradiction.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Terry PUSHED the door shut.,Terry opened the door wide.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""Terry PUSHED the door shut.""
   - This indicates that Terry applied force to close the door.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""Terry opened the door wide.""
   - This indicates that Terry moved the door in the opposite direction, making it open widely.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The action of pushing the door shut (closing it) is directly opposite to the action of opening the door wide.
   - If Terry pushed the door shut, it is impossible for the door to be open wide at the same time.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Terry PUSHED the door shut.,Terry shut the door by pushing it closed.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Terry PUSHED the door shut.""
   - This statement indicates that Terry used a pushing action to close the door.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Terry shut the door by pushing it closed.""
   - This statement also indicates that Terry used a pushing action to close the door.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action: Terry closing the door by pushing it.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with no additional information or contradiction.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they describe the same event in different words), the relationship is one of **Entailment**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value for the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,He ATE himself sick.,He ate questionably fresh shellfish.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""He ATE himself sick.""
   - This means that the person ate so much or something so bad that it made him sick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""He ate questionably fresh shellfish.""
   - This suggests that the person ate shellfish that might not have been fresh, which could potentially make someone sick.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise directly implies it. For example, if the Premise stated that he ate shellfish and got sick, then the Hypothesis would be entailed.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not specify what he ate, only that he ate himself sick. The Hypothesis introduces new information (the type of food) that is not directly confirmed or denied by the Premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise directly contradicts it. For example, if the Premise stated that he ate only vegetables, then the Hypothesis about shellfish would be a contradiction.

Given that the Premise does not specify what he ate, only that he ate himself sick, the Hypothesis about eating questionably fresh shellfish is a plausible scenario but not necessarily the only one. Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise.

Thus, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,He ATE himself sick.,He didn't eat.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""He ATE himself sick.""
   - This means that the person ate so much that it made him feel sick. The key action here is ""ATE,"" indicating that the person consumed food.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""He didn't eat.""
   - This statement asserts that the person did not consume any food.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the person ate to the point of feeling sick.
   - The Hypothesis states that the person did not eat at all.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If the person ate to the point of feeling sick (Premise), it is impossible for the person to have not eaten at all (Hypothesis).
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final output:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,He ATE himself sick.,He felt sick from eating.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""He ATE himself sick.""
   - This means that the person ate so much that it caused him to feel sick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""He felt sick from eating.""
   - This means that the person felt sick as a result of eating.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis states that the person felt sick due to eating, which aligns with the Premise that he ate himself sick.
   - The Premise provides a specific cause (eating too much) for the sickness, which directly supports the Hypothesis.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because the Premise explicitly states that eating led to feeling sick.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,She COUGHED herself sick.,She coughed too much from choking.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""She COUGHED herself sick.""
   - This means that the person coughed so much that it made her feel sick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""She coughed too much from choking.""
   - This suggests that the reason for her excessive coughing was choking.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that she coughed to the point of making herself sick, but it does not specify the reason for the coughing.
   - The Hypothesis provides a specific reason for the coughing (choking), which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information (the reason for coughing) that is not present in the Premise.
   - The Premise does not confirm or deny the reason for the coughing; it only states the outcome (she became sick from coughing).

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise because the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or contradict the reason for the coughing.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,She COUGHED herself sick.,Her coughing resulted in her feeling better.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""She COUGHED herself sick.""
   - This means that due to her coughing, she became sick. The coughing had a negative impact on her health.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""Her coughing resulted in her feeling better.""
   - This means that the coughing had a positive impact on her health, making her feel better.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that coughing made her sick (negative outcome).
   - The Hypothesis states that coughing made her feel better (positive outcome).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis present opposite outcomes of the same action (coughing). The Premise indicates a negative result (sickness), while the Hypothesis indicates a positive result (feeling better).
   - Since these outcomes are directly contradictory, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,She COUGHED herself sick.,She got sick from coughing.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""She COUGHED herself sick.""
   - This statement indicates that the act of coughing led to her becoming sick. The phrase ""COUGHED herself sick"" implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship where coughing is the cause and becoming sick is the effect.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""She got sick from coughing.""
   - This statement also indicates that the act of coughing led to her becoming sick. It essentially restates the cause-and-effect relationship described in the premise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same cause-and-effect relationship: coughing led to her becoming sick.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or adds uncertainty to the information provided in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

resultative,schematic,The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.,The jackhammer pounding sometimes reaches 130 decibels.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.""
   - This statement indicates that the jackhammer was extremely loud, to the point of causing deafness.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The jackhammer pounding sometimes reaches 130 decibels.""
   - This statement provides a specific measurement of the jackhammer's noise level, suggesting that it can reach 130 decibels.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes the subjective experience of the jackhammer's noise, emphasizing its loudness and impact on hearing.
   - The Hypothesis provides an objective measurement of the noise level, which is 130 decibels.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise would need to imply that the jackhammer's noise level is specifically 130 decibels. The Premise does not provide this specific information.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise indicates that the jackhammer was very loud, but it does not specify the exact decibel level. Therefore, the Hypothesis could be true, but it is not definitively supported by the Premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to imply that the jackhammer's noise level is not 130 decibels. The Premise does not provide any information that contradicts the possibility of the jackhammer reaching 130 decibels.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is **Neutral (1)**, as the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the specific decibel level mentioned in the Hypothesis.

**Final Answer**: 1",**Final Answer**: 1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.,The jackhammer was easy on our ears.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.""
   - This statement indicates that the jackhammer was extremely loud, to the point of causing deafness.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""The jackhammer was easy on our ears.""
   - This statement suggests that the jackhammer was not loud and did not cause any discomfort to the ears.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the jackhammer was extremely loud and caused deafness.
   - The Hypothesis states that the jackhammer was not loud and was easy on the ears.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The two statements are directly contradictory. If the jackhammer was extremely loud and caused deafness, it cannot simultaneously be easy on the ears.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.,We were deaf from the jackhammering.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.""
   - This sentence indicates that the noise from the jackhammer was so loud and intense that it caused deafness.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""We were deaf from the jackhammering.""
   - This sentence states that the cause of the deafness was the jackhammering.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that the jackhammer caused deafness.
   - The Hypothesis states that the deafness was caused by the jackhammering.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise. The Premise provides a clear cause (jackhammering) and effect (deafness) relationship, which is exactly what the Hypothesis states.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

resultative,schematic,Water FILLED the tub half full.,The half-full tub was dirty.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Water FILLED the tub half full.""
   - This means that the tub is now half full of water.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The half-full tub was dirty.""
   - This statement is about the condition of the tub (specifically, that it was dirty).

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the tub was dirty. The Premise only mentions the water filling the tub to half full and does not provide any information about the cleanliness of the tub.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true or false based on the Premise. The Premise does not give any information about the cleanliness of the tub, so it is possible that the tub was dirty, but it is also possible that it was clean.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that directly contradicts the Hypothesis. The Premise does not provide any information about the cleanliness of the tub, so it does not contradict the Hypothesis.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Water FILLED the tub half full.,Water drained from the tub.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Water FILLED the tub half full.""
   - This means that water was added to the tub until it reached the halfway mark.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Water drained from the tub.""
   - This implies that water was removed from the tub.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a situation where water is being added to the tub.
   - The Hypothesis describes a situation where water is being removed from the tub.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are opposite in nature: filling vs. draining.
   - If water is being filled into the tub, it cannot simultaneously be draining from the tub.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

resultative,schematic,Water FILLED the tub half full.,The tub was half full of water.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: Water FILLED the tub half full.
Hypothesis: The tub was half full of water.

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The Premise states that water filled the tub to the halfway point. This means that the tub is now half full of water.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that the tub was half full of water. This is a description of the state of the tub after the action described in the Premise.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise describes an action that results in the tub being half full of water.
   - The Hypothesis describes the state of the tub as being half full of water.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - If the tub was filled half full of water, it logically follows that the tub is half full of water. The Hypothesis is a direct consequence of the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

resultative,schematic,The sleeping pills MADE me sick.,I took sleeping pills before bed.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""The sleeping pills MADE me sick.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker took sleeping pills and experienced sickness as a result.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""I took sleeping pills before bed.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker took sleeping pills before going to bed.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The Premise clearly states that the speaker took sleeping pills, which caused sickness.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker took sleeping pills before bed, but it does not specify the time of taking the pills in relation to the sickness.
   - The Premise does not provide information about the time of taking the pills (e.g., before bed or at some other time).

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - The Hypothesis (""I took sleeping pills before bed"") may or may not be true given the Premise (""The sleeping pills MADE me sick"").
   - The Premise confirms that the speaker took sleeping pills, but it does not confirm the specific time (before bed).
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is not definitely true or false based on the Premise alone.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The sleeping pills MADE me sick.""
   - This indicates that the sleeping pills caused the speaker to feel sick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The sleeping pills make me feel good.""
   - This suggests that the sleeping pills cause the speaker to feel good.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis describe opposite effects of the sleeping pills.
   - The Premise indicates a negative effect (sickness), while the Hypothesis indicates a positive effect (feeling good).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise and the Hypothesis describe mutually exclusive outcomes (sickness vs. feeling good), the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The sleeping pills MADE me sick.,I was sick from the sleeping pills I took.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The sleeping pills MADE me sick.
Hypothesis: I was sick from the sleeping pills I took.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The statement ""The sleeping pills MADE me sick"" indicates that the speaker attributes their sickness directly to the sleeping pills.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The statement ""I was sick from the sleeping pills I took"" suggests that the speaker was sick and attributes this sickness to the sleeping pills they consumed.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - Both statements indicate that the speaker was sick.
   - Both statements attribute the cause of the sickness to the sleeping pills.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and does not introduce any new or contradictory information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

resultative,schematic,Harry SHOT Sam dead.,Harry hated Sam all of his life.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Harry SHOT Sam dead.""
   - This statement indicates that Harry killed Sam by shooting him. It is a clear and specific action.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Harry hated Sam all of his life.""
   - This statement suggests that Harry had a long-standing hatred for Sam.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis:

- **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide definitive evidence that Harry hated Sam all of his life. The Premise only states that Harry shot Sam dead, which does not necessarily imply a lifelong hatred. There could be other reasons for the shooting.

- **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The act of shooting someone dead could be motivated by hatred, but it could also be motivated by other factors such as self-defense, a moment of rage, or other circumstances. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the lifelong hatred.

- **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly opposes the idea that Harry hated Sam all of his life. The Premise does not provide any such information; it simply states the act of shooting.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Harry SHOT Sam dead.,Harry saved Sam's life.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""Harry SHOT Sam dead.""
   - This statement clearly indicates that Harry killed Sam by shooting him. Sam is dead as a result of Harry's action.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""Harry saved Sam's life.""
   - This statement suggests that Harry performed an action that resulted in Sam being alive, implying that Sam's life was preserved or protected by Harry.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Sam is dead because Harry shot him.
   - The Hypothesis states that Sam's life was saved by Harry, meaning Sam is alive.

4. **Inference**:
   - The two statements are directly contradictory. If Sam is dead (as per the Premise), he cannot be alive (as per the Hypothesis). Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

resultative,schematic,Harry SHOT Sam dead.,Sam died from the shot Harry took.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Harry SHOT Sam dead.""
   - This means that Harry shot Sam, resulting in Sam's death.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Sam died from the shot Harry took.""
   - This means that Sam's death was caused by the shot that Harry fired.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that Harry shot Sam dead, which directly implies that Sam died as a result of Harry's shot.
   - The Hypothesis states that Sam died from the shot Harry took, which is essentially a rephrasing of the information given in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a direct restatement of the information provided in the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,Sam TALKED himself hoarse.,Sam likes to talk.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Sam TALKED himself hoarse.""
   - This means that Sam talked so much that he became hoarse, indicating a significant amount of talking.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Sam likes to talk.""
   - This suggests that Sam has a preference or enjoyment for talking.

3. **Inference Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise must provide enough information to confirm the Hypothesis without any doubt.
   - **Neutral (1)**: For the Hypothesis to be possibly true given the Premise, the Premise should provide some information that makes the Hypothesis plausible but not certain.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise must provide information that directly contradicts the Hypothesis.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The Premise indicates that Sam talked so much that he became hoarse. This suggests that Sam is capable of talking a lot, which could imply that he likes to talk.
   - However, the Premise does not explicitly state that Sam likes to talk; it only indicates that he talked a lot on this occasion. There could be other reasons for Sam talking a lot (e.g., he was forced to talk, he had to give a long speech, etc.).
   - Therefore, while the Premise makes the Hypothesis plausible, it does not definitively confirm it.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as **Neutral**.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Sam TALKED himself hoarse.,Sam's talking made his voice clearer.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Sam TALKED himself hoarse.""
   - This means that Sam talked so much that his voice became hoarse, which typically implies that his voice became rough or strained.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Sam's talking made his voice clearer.""
   - This suggests that as a result of Sam's talking, his voice became clearer, which is the opposite of becoming hoarse.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that Sam's voice became hoarse due to talking.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that Sam's voice became clearer due to talking.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The two statements are contradictory because a hoarse voice is not clear; they describe opposite outcomes of the same action (talking).

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Sam TALKED himself hoarse.,Sam's voice was hoarse from talking.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Sam TALKED himself hoarse.""
   - This means that Sam engaged in talking to such an extent that it caused his voice to become hoarse.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Sam's voice was hoarse from talking.""
   - This means that the reason for Sam's hoarse voice is due to talking.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that Sam talked himself hoarse, which directly implies that his voice became hoarse because of talking.
   - The Hypothesis states that Sam's voice was hoarse from talking, which is essentially a restatement of the cause and effect described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because it directly follows from the information provided in the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

The numerical value corresponding to Entailment is **0**.

Final answer:

resultative,schematic,He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.,His house was previously a darker color.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.""
   - This indicates that the house is now a bright shade of red due to the action of painting.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""His house was previously a darker color.""
   - This suggests that before the house was painted a bright shade of red, it was a darker color.

3. **Inference Relationship**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the previous color of the house. It only states the current color after painting.
   - The Hypothesis makes an assumption about the previous color, which is not supported or contradicted by the Premise.

Given that the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the previous color of the house, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct relation output is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.,He scraped off the red paint from his house.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.""
   - This indicates that the action of painting the house in a bright shade of red has been completed.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""He scraped off the red paint from his house.""
   - This suggests that the red paint, which was previously applied, is being removed.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, it must be definitely true given the Premise. However, the Premise only tells us that the house was painted red, not that the paint was later scraped off.
   - **Neutral (1)**: For the Hypothesis to be neutral, it must be possible but not certain given the Premise. The Premise does not provide any information about what happened after the house was painted red, so it is possible that the paint was scraped off, but it is not certain.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, it must be impossible given the Premise. The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise because it is possible to paint a house red and then later scrape off the paint.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.,His house was bright red from paint.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.""
   - This statement indicates that an action was taken to apply a bright shade of red paint to the house.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""His house was bright red from paint.""
   - This statement indicates that the house is bright red as a result of being painted.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis states that the house is bright red due to paint, which aligns with the information given in the Premise that the house was painted a bright shade of red.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,She KICKED the door open.,She needed to get into the house quickly.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""She KICKED the door open.""
   - This statement indicates that a person used force to open a door by kicking it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""She needed to get into the house quickly.""
   - This statement suggests a reason or motivation for why someone might act urgently to enter a house.

3. **Relation Analysis**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise must provide clear evidence that the action was motivated by a need to enter quickly. The Premise does not explicitly state the reason for kicking the door open.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The action of kicking the door open could be due to needing to get into the house quickly, but it could also be due to other reasons (e.g., frustration, an emergency, or simply a dramatic gesture).
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to provide information that directly contradicts the need to enter quickly. The Premise does not provide such contradictory information.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is **Neutral (1)** because the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the Hypothesis.

**Final Answer**: 1",**Final Answer**: 1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,She KICKED the door open.,She slowly opened the door.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""She KICKED the door open.""
   - This indicates a forceful and sudden action to open the door.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""She slowly opened the door.""
   - This indicates a gentle and gradual action to open the door.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a forceful and sudden action (kicking the door open).
   - The Hypothesis describes a gentle and gradual action (slowly opening the door).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are mutually exclusive. If she kicked the door open, she could not have opened it slowly. Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final output:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,She KICKED the door open.,The door was open from her kick.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""She KICKED the door open.""
   - This statement indicates that an action was performed by ""She"" (a female subject) to open the door by kicking it.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The door was open from her kick.""
   - This statement suggests that the door became open as a result of her kick.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that the door was opened by her kicking it.
   - The Hypothesis states that the door was open as a result of her kick.
   - There is a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the action described in the Premise and the state described in the Hypothesis.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because the action of kicking the door open directly leads to the door being open from her kick.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,She tugged at the glass door.,She had a sliding glass door to her backyard.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""She tugged at the glass door.""
   - This statement indicates that there is a glass door and that she is pulling on it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She had a sliding glass door to her backyard.""
   - This statement suggests that she possesses a sliding glass door that leads to her backyard.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions a glass door being tugged, which implies a door that can be pulled open. Sliding glass doors typically slide rather than being pulled open.
   - The Hypothesis specifies a sliding glass door, which is a specific type of door that does not match the action described in the Premise (tugging).

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise provided clear evidence that the door was a sliding glass door. However, the Premise does not specify the type of glass door.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true if the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the type of door. However, the action of tugging suggests a non-sliding door.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise implies a type of door that is not a sliding door. Since tugging is not an action associated with sliding doors, this suggests a contradiction.

Given the analysis, the action of tugging at the door contradicts the idea of it being a sliding glass door.

**Final Decision**:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,She tugged at the glass door.,She made no motion towards the glass door.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""She tugged at the glass door.""
   - This indicates that the subject (she) made a physical action towards the glass door, specifically pulling or tugging it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""She made no motion towards the glass door.""
   - This indicates that the subject (she) did not make any physical action towards the glass door.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that she did make a motion (tugging) towards the glass door.
   - The Hypothesis states that she did not make any motion towards the glass door.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If she tugged at the glass door, it is impossible that she made no motion towards it.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,She tugged at the glass door.,She attempted to tug the glass door.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""She tugged at the glass door.""
   - This statement indicates that the action of tugging at the glass door has already occurred.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""She attempted to tug the glass door.""
   - This statement suggests that she made an effort to tug the glass door, but it does not confirm whether the action was completed.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The Premise confirms that the action of tugging at the glass door was completed.
   - The Hypothesis only suggests an attempt to tug the glass door, which is a less definitive action than actually tugging it.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - Since the Premise confirms the action was completed, and the Hypothesis only suggests an attempt, the Hypothesis is not definitively true given the Premise. The action of attempting does not necessarily imply completion.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He tugged at the puppy's ears.,He had a puppy with long ears.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""He tugged at the puppy's ears.""
   - This statement tells us that there is a puppy and someone is tugging at its ears.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""He had a puppy with long ears.""
   - This statement suggests that the person has a puppy and that the puppy has long ears.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the length of the puppy's ears. It only mentions that the person tugged at the puppy's ears.
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information (the length of the ears) that is not present in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - Since the Premise does not confirm or deny the length of the puppy's ears, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the given Premise. There is no definitive information in the Premise to conclude the length of the ears.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He tugged at the puppy's ears.,He pushed the puppy's ears.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He tugged at the puppy's ears.""
   - The action described is ""tugged,"" which means to pull something sharply.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""He pushed the puppy's ears.""
   - The action described is ""pushed,"" which means to exert force on something to move it away.

3. **Comparison**:
   - ""Tugged"" and ""pushed"" are different actions. Tugging involves pulling, while pushing involves moving something away.
   - The actions are not synonymous and imply different types of interactions with the puppy's ears.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - Since ""tugged"" and ""pushed"" describe different actions, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. The actions are mutually exclusive in this context.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He tugged at the puppy's ears.,The puppy's ears were tugged by him.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""He tugged at the puppy's ears.""
2. **Hypothesis:** ""The puppy's ears were tugged by him.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Subject and Object Consistency:**
  - In the Premise, ""He"" is the subject performing the action of tugging.
  - In the Hypothesis, ""him"" (which refers to ""He"" in the Premise) is the agent performing the action of tugging.

- **Action Consistency:**
  - The action described in the Premise is ""tugged at the puppy's ears.""
  - The action described in the Hypothesis is ""the puppy's ears were tugged by him.""

- **Passive vs. Active Voice:**
  - The Premise is in active voice: ""He tugged at the puppy's ears.""
  - The Hypothesis is in passive voice: ""The puppy's ears were tugged by him.""

- **Semantic Equivalence:**
  - Both statements describe the same event: the action of tugging the puppy's ears performed by ""He"" (or ""him"").

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise in passive voice, but it conveys the exact same information. Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

### Relation:

conative,partial,"I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.",I tried to break my door down to leave my house.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.""
   - This indicates that the speaker attempted to open the door by kicking it, but the door remained closed.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I tried to break my door down to leave my house.""
   - This suggests that the speaker attempted to forcefully open the door with the intention of leaving the house.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an action (kicking the door) and the result (the door didn't budge).
   - The Hypothesis describes an intention (trying to break the door down) and a purpose (to leave the house).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state the intention behind kicking the door, but it is reasonable to infer that the speaker might have been trying to open it, possibly to leave the house.
   - However, the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the speaker was trying to leave the house. The intention to leave the house is an additional detail not present in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.",The door swung open immediately from one kick.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.""
- This indicates that the speaker kicked the door multiple times, and despite these efforts, the door did not move or open.

Hypothesis: ""The door swung open immediately from one kick.""
- This suggests that the door opened right away with just a single kick.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

1. **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, it must be definitely true given the Premise. However, the Premise states that the door did not budge even after multiple kicks, which directly contradicts the Hypothesis that the door opened immediately from one kick. Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be an entailment.

2. **Neutral (1)**: For the Hypothesis to be neutral, it must be possible but not certain given the Premise. In this case, the Hypothesis is not possible given the Premise because the Premise explicitly states that the door did not budge after multiple kicks.

3. **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, it must be impossible given the Premise. Since the Premise states that the door did not budge after multiple kicks, it directly contradicts the Hypothesis that the door swung open immediately from one kick.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.",The door didn't budge from my multiple kicks at it.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.""
   - This sentence states that the speaker kicked the door multiple times, but the door did not move or open as a result.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The door didn't budge from my multiple kicks at it.""
   - This sentence states that the door did not move or open as a result of the speaker's multiple kicks.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis directly restates the outcome described in the Premise: the door did not budge despite multiple kicks.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a direct restatement of the outcome described in the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

conative,partial,Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.,Henry Edison had gotten a flat on his old automobile.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.""
   - This statement describes an action where Henry Edison is kicking at the tire of an old automobile. It does not provide any explicit reason for why he is doing this.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Henry Edison had gotten a flat on his old automobile.""
   - This statement suggests that Henry Edison has a flat tire on his old automobile.

3. **Inference Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that Henry Edison had gotten a flat tire. The Premise does not explicitly state that there is a flat tire; it only mentions that Henry is kicking at the tire.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it is not necessarily true. Kicking at a tire could be due to a flat tire, but it could also be due to other reasons (e.g., frustration, checking the tire's condition, etc.). The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the flat tire.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly conflicts with the idea of having a flat tire. The Premise does not provide any such conflicting information.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relationship is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.,Hendy Edison shined his tire on his new automobile.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.
Hypothesis: Hendy Edison shined his tire on his new automobile.

1. **Subject Comparison**:
   - Premise: Henry Edison
   - Hypothesis: Hendy Edison
   - The names are slightly different, but let's assume they refer to the same person due to a possible typo.

2. **Action Comparison**:
   - Premise: kicked at the tire
   - Hypothesis: shined his tire
   - The actions are different. Kicking a tire and shining a tire are not related actions.

3. **Object Comparison**:
   - Premise: the tire on the old automobile
   - Hypothesis: his tire on his new automobile
   - The objects are different. The Premise mentions an old automobile, while the Hypothesis mentions a new automobile.

4. **Temporal and Contextual Consistency**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis describe different actions (kicking vs. shining) and different contexts (old automobile vs. new automobile).

Given these differences, the Hypothesis cannot be true based on the information provided in the Premise. The actions and contexts are contradictory.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.,Henry Edison tried to kick the tire on the old automobile.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.
Hypothesis: Henry Edison tried to kick the tire on the old automobile.

1. **Identify the action in the Premise:**
   - The action described is ""kicked at the tire.""

2. **Identify the action in the Hypothesis:**
   - The action described is ""tried to kick the tire.""

3. **Compare the actions:**
   - ""Kicked at"" implies that Henry Edison made contact with the tire or at least made a kicking motion towards it.
   - ""Tried to kick"" implies an attempt to kick, which may or may not have resulted in actual contact with the tire.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - If Henry Edison ""kicked at"" the tire, it is possible that he tried to kick it. However, ""kicked at"" suggests a more definitive action than merely trying. Therefore, the Hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the Premise because ""kicked at"" is a stronger statement than ""tried to kick.""

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise. The Premise does not definitively confirm the Hypothesis, nor does it contradict it.

Therefore, the relation is:

conative,partial,Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.,Luke tested the durability of the chair with his shoe.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.""
   - This sentence describes an action where Luke uses his leather half-boot to kick the leg of a chair.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Luke tested the durability of the chair with his shoe.""
   - This sentence suggests that Luke's action was intended to test the chair's durability using his shoe.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Luke kicked the chair leg with his boot.
   - The Hypothesis interprets this action as a test of the chair's durability using his shoe.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must definitively imply that Luke's action was a test of the chair's durability. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm that the purpose of the kick was to test durability.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it is not necessarily true. The Premise does not specify the intention behind Luke's action, so it is possible but not certain that he was testing the chair's durability.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly opposes the idea that Luke was testing the chair's durability. The Premise does not provide such contradictory information.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.,Luke pushed the chair away with his tennis shoe.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.""
   - This sentence describes an action where Luke uses his leather half-boot to kick at the leg of a chair.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Luke pushed the chair away with his tennis shoe.""
   - This sentence describes an action where Luke uses his tennis shoe to push the chair away.

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Action**: The actions described are different. The Premise describes kicking, while the Hypothesis describes pushing.
   - **Footwear**: The Premise mentions a leather half-boot, while the Hypothesis mentions a tennis shoe.
   - **Result**: The Premise does not specify the result of the kicking action, while the Hypothesis implies a result (pushing the chair away).

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions (kicking vs. pushing) and the footwear (leather half-boot vs. tennis shoe) are different.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true because it describes a different action with different footwear.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

   - ""Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.""
   - This sentence describes an action performed by Luke, specifically kicking at a chair leg using the toe of his leather half-boot.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The chair leg was kicked at with Luke's toe of his leather half-boot.""
   - This sentence describes the same action but from a slightly different perspective, focusing on the chair leg being kicked at with Luke's toe of his leather half-boot.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: Luke kicking at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the action described in the Premise without adding or contradicting any information.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He looked down and poked at the keyboard.,He was typing on his computer.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He looked down and poked at the keyboard.""
   - This statement describes an action where someone is interacting with a keyboard.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""He was typing on his computer.""
   - This statement suggests that the person was engaged in the activity of typing on a computer.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The action of ""poking at the keyboard"" strongly implies that the person is interacting with a keyboard, which is a key component of typing.
   - The phrase ""looked down"" suggests a focus on the keyboard, which is consistent with the activity of typing.
   - The hypothesis specifies that the keyboard is part of a computer, which is a reasonable assumption given the context of modern usage.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The hypothesis ""He was typing on his computer"" is a logical and reasonable conclusion given the premise ""He looked down and poked at the keyboard.""
   - There is no information in the premise that contradicts the hypothesis.
   - The hypothesis is not merely possible but is strongly supported by the premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He looked down and poked at the keyboard.,He looked up at his computer screen.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He looked down and poked at the keyboard.""
   - This indicates that the person is looking down and interacting with the keyboard.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""He looked up at his computer screen.""
   - This suggests that the person is looking up at the computer screen.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the person is looking down at the keyboard.
   - The Hypothesis states that the person is looking up at the computer screen.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are mutually exclusive in the context of a single moment in time. If someone is looking down at the keyboard, they cannot simultaneously be looking up at the computer screen.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He looked down and poked at the keyboard.,He looked down and made poking motions in the direction of the keyboard.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He looked down and poked at the keyboard.""
   - This statement describes a person looking down and performing a poking action directed at the keyboard.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He looked down and made poking motions in the direction of the keyboard.""
   - This statement describes a person looking down and making poking motions towards the keyboard.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same actions: looking down and making poking motions towards the keyboard.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with slightly different wording but the same meaning.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they describe the same scenario), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.,Mary Elizabeth was testing the softness of the potatoes.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.""
   - This indicates that Mary Elizabeth performed an action involving the potatoes, specifically poking at them.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Mary Elizabeth was testing the softness of the potatoes.""
   - This suggests that the action of poking at the potatoes was done to test their softness.

3. **Inference Relation Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise must explicitly or implicitly confirm that the action of poking was for testing softness. The Premise does not explicitly state the reason for poking the potatoes.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise describes an action (poking at the potatoes) but does not provide the reason for this action. Testing the softness is a plausible reason, but it is not the only possible reason.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. There is no information in the Premise that directly contradicts the idea that Mary Elizabeth was testing the softness of the potatoes.

Given that the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the reason for poking the potatoes, the most appropriate relation is Neutral.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.,Mary Elizabeth stared at the potatoes but made no move towards them.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.""
   - This indicates that Mary Elizabeth took an active action towards the potatoes by jumping up and poking them.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Mary Elizabeth stared at the potatoes but made no move towards them.""
   - This suggests that Mary Elizabeth did not take any action towards the potatoes; she only stared at them.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Mary Elizabeth actively interacted with the potatoes.
   - The Hypothesis states that Mary Elizabeth did not interact with the potatoes at all.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If Mary Elizabeth poked at the potatoes, she must have made a move towards them, which is the opposite of what the Hypothesis claims.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.,The potatoes were poked at as Mary Elizabeth jumped up.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.
Hypothesis: The potatoes were poked at as Mary Elizabeth jumped up.

1. **Identify the actions and subjects in both sentences:**
   - Premise: The subject is ""Mary Elizabeth,"" and the actions are ""jumped up"" and ""poked at the potatoes.""
   - Hypothesis: The subject is ""Mary Elizabeth,"" and the actions are ""jumped up"" and ""poked at the potatoes.""

2. **Check for consistency in actions and subjects:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same actions (""jumped up"" and ""poked at the potatoes"") performed by the same subject (""Mary Elizabeth"").

3. **Determine the temporal and causal relationship:**
   - The Premise states that Mary Elizabeth ""jumped up and poked at the potatoes,"" implying a sequence of actions.
   - The Hypothesis states that ""the potatoes were poked at as Mary Elizabeth jumped up,"" which also implies a sequence of actions where the poking happens as she jumps up.

4. **Evaluate the logical consistency:**
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise without altering the meaning. Both sentences describe the same event with the same sequence of actions.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.,I had a straw in my cold drink.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker has a drink with ice cubes in it. It does not provide any information about the presence or absence of a straw.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I had a straw in my cold drink.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker's drink has a straw in it. It also implies that the drink is cold, which is consistent with having ice cubes.

3. **Inference Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise must explicitly or implicitly confirm the presence of a straw. The Premise does not mention a straw, so we cannot be certain that there is one.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the presence of a straw. It is possible that the drink has a straw, but it is also possible that it does not.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to indicate that there is no straw. The Premise does not provide any information that contradicts the presence of a straw.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relationship is Neutral (1), as the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the presence of a straw.

**Relation Output**: 1",**Relation Output**: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.,I left the ice cubes in my drink alone.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker interacted with the ice cubes in their drink by poking at them.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I left the ice cubes in my drink alone.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker did not interact with the ice cubes in their drink and left them untouched.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker poked at the ice cubes, which is an action involving interaction with the ice cubes.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker left the ice cubes alone, which means no interaction with the ice cubes.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the speaker poked at the ice cubes (Premise), it directly contradicts the idea that the speaker left the ice cubes alone (Hypothesis).
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.,I moved around ice cubes in my drink.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.""
   - This statement describes an action where the speaker is interacting with the ice cubes in their drink by poking at them.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I moved around ice cubes in my drink.""
   - This statement describes an action where the speaker is moving the ice cubes around in their drink.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Poking at the ice cubes can be considered a form of moving them around, as poking typically results in some movement.
   - The action described in the Hypothesis is a broader description that encompasses the action described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given that poking at the ice cubes (Premise) would result in moving them around (Hypothesis), the Hypothesis is definitely true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.,Marco had been up very high on a ladder.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.
Hypothesis: Marco had been up very high on a ladder.

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - Marco lost his balance.
   - Marco grabbed at the ladder railing.

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - Marco had been up very high on a ladder.

3. **Determine if the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise:**
   - The Premise indicates that Marco was on a ladder and lost his balance, causing him to grab the railing. However, it does not specify how high up Marco was on the ladder. He could have been on a lower rung or a higher rung; the height is not mentioned.

4. **Determine if the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise:**
   - Since the Premise does not provide information about the height Marco was at on the ladder, the Hypothesis that Marco had been up very high on a ladder is possible but not certain. The Premise does not confirm or deny the height.

5. **Determine if the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise:**
   - There is no information in the Premise that directly contradicts the Hypothesis. The Hypothesis is not ruled out by the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.,Marco maintained balance and didn't need the ladder railing.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.""
   - This indicates that Marco was in a situation where he lost his balance and, as a result, he grabbed the ladder railing to steady himself.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Marco maintained balance and didn't need the ladder railing.""
   - This suggests that Marco did not lose his balance and therefore did not need to grab the ladder railing.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Marco lost his balance and grabbed the ladder railing.
   - The Hypothesis states that Marco maintained his balance and did not need the ladder railing.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If Marco lost his balance and grabbed the ladder railing (Premise), it cannot be true that he maintained his balance and didn't need the ladder railing (Hypothesis).

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.,Marco grabbed at the ladder railing as he lost his balance.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.
Hypothesis: Marco grabbed at the ladder railing as he lost his balance.

1. **Identify the key events in the Premise:**
   - Marco lost his balance.
   - Marco grabbed at the ladder railing.

2. **Identify the key events in the Hypothesis:**
   - Marco grabbed at the ladder railing.
   - Marco lost his balance.

3. **Compare the events and their sequence:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same two events: Marco losing his balance and grabbing at the ladder railing.
   - The sequence of events in the Hypothesis is slightly rephrased but essentially conveys the same meaning as the Premise.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and maintains the same meaning.

Given that the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.,I tried to fix the springs in the toy.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.""
   - This statement describes an action where the speaker is applying pressure to springs using their hands.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I tried to fix the springs in the toy.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker's intention was to repair or adjust springs that are part of a toy.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a specific action (pushing at the springs) but does not provide context about the purpose or the object involved (e.g., a toy).
   - The Hypothesis adds context by suggesting that the action was part of an attempt to fix springs in a toy.

4. **Inference Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true, the Premise must explicitly or implicitly confirm that the action was part of fixing springs in a toy. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm this.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise. The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, but it also does not provide enough information to confirm it. The action of pushing at the springs could be part of fixing a toy, but it could also be part of some other activity.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false, the Premise would need to provide information that directly contradicts the idea of fixing springs in a toy. The Premise does not do this.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relationship is Neutral (1), as the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the Hypothesis.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.,I released the springs with the tips of my fingers.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.""
   - This statement describes an action where the speaker is applying force to the springs using the palms of their hands.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I released the springs with the tips of my fingers.""
   - This statement describes a different action where the speaker is releasing the springs using the tips of their fingers.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise involves pushing the springs with the palms of the hands.
   - The Hypothesis involves releasing the springs with the tips of the fingers.
   - These two actions are different: pushing vs. releasing and palms vs. fingers.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise directly implied it. However, pushing the springs with the palms does not imply releasing them with the fingers.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true or false given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to determine whether the action of releasing the springs with the fingers happened or not.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if it directly contradicted the Premise. However, pushing the springs with the palms does not directly contradict releasing them with the fingers; they are simply different actions.

Given that the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the action described in the Hypothesis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.,I pushed the palms of my hands against the springs.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.""
Hypothesis: ""I pushed the palms of my hands against the springs.""

1. **Identify the main action in both sentences:**
   - Premise: ""pushed at the springs""
   - Hypothesis: ""pushed the palms of my hands against the springs""

2. **Identify the subject and object in both sentences:**
   - Premise: Subject is ""I"", action is ""pushed"", object is ""the springs"", and the instrument used is ""the palms of my hands"".
   - Hypothesis: Subject is ""I"", action is ""pushed"", object is ""the palms of my hands"", and the target is ""the springs"".

3. **Compare the actions and objects:**
   - Both sentences describe the same action of pushing.
   - The instrument used in the Premise (""the palms of my hands"") is the same as the object being pushed in the Hypothesis.
   - The target of the pushing action in both sentences is ""the springs"".

4. **Determine if the Hypothesis is definitely true, possibly true, or definitely false given the Premise:**
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the action described in the Premise without changing the meaning. Both sentences describe the same event using slightly different wording.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.,His belly pushed at the buttons of the hotel elevator through his shirt.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.""
   - This sentence describes a person whose belly is pressing against the buttons of their shirt, which is specifically described as a white and blue Aloha shirt.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""His belly pushed at the buttons of the hotel elevator through his shirt.""
   - This sentence describes a person whose belly is pressing against the buttons of a hotel elevator, and it mentions that this is happening through his shirt.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about the buttons of a shirt being pushed by a belly.
   - The Hypothesis talks about the buttons of a hotel elevator being pushed by a belly through a shirt.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise would need to mention the hotel elevator buttons being pushed by the belly through the shirt. This is not the case.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the scenario described in the Hypothesis. It is possible that the person could be pushing the hotel elevator buttons through their shirt, but the Premise does not specify this.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise if the Premise explicitly stated something that contradicts the Hypothesis. However, the Premise does not provide any information that directly contradicts the Hypothesis.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.,The white and blue Aloha shirt hung on his thin frame.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.""
   - This suggests that the person is likely overweight or has a large belly, causing the shirt to be tight around the buttons.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The white and blue Aloha shirt hung on his thin frame.""
   - This suggests that the person is thin, and the shirt is loose on him.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the shirt is tight because of a large belly.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that the shirt is loose because the person is thin.

4. **Inference**:
   - The two statements describe opposite physical conditions of the person wearing the shirt.
   - If the person has a large belly pushing at the buttons, it is impossible for the same shirt to hang loosely on a thin frame.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.,The white and blue Aloha shirt buttons stretched over his belly.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.""
   - This indicates that the person's belly is exerting pressure on the buttons of the shirt, suggesting that the shirt is tight around the belly area.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The white and blue Aloha shirt buttons stretched over his belly.""
   - This suggests that the buttons of the shirt are being stretched due to the belly, implying that the shirt is tight around the belly area.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a situation where the shirt is tight around the belly, causing the buttons to be under pressure or stretched.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with the same underlying meaning.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they describe the same situation in different words), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He pushed at the doorbell.,He wanted to see if someone was home.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He pushed at the doorbell.""
   - This statement describes an action where someone is pressing a doorbell.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""He wanted to see if someone was home.""
   - This statement suggests a possible motivation for pressing the doorbell, which is to check if someone is present in the house.

3. **Inference Evaluation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the action of pressing the doorbell must unequivocally indicate the desire to see if someone is home. However, pressing a doorbell could have other motivations (e.g., delivering a package, playing a prank, etc.).
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. Pressing the doorbell could indeed be because the person wants to see if someone is home, but it is not the only possible reason.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. This would mean that pressing the doorbell explicitly indicates that the person does not want to see if someone is home, which is not the case here.

Given that the action of pressing the doorbell does not necessarily entail the specific motivation of wanting to see if someone is home, but it is a plausible reason among others, the relationship is best described as Neutral.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He pushed at the doorbell.,He hovered over the doorbell.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He pushed at the doorbell.""
   - This indicates that the person made physical contact with the doorbell and applied force to it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""He hovered over the doorbell.""
   - This suggests that the person was near the doorbell but did not make physical contact with it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the person pushed the doorbell, which implies direct physical interaction.
   - The Hypothesis states that the person hovered over the doorbell, which implies no physical interaction.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise indicates physical contact and the Hypothesis indicates no physical contact, these two statements cannot both be true simultaneously. The action of pushing the doorbell contradicts the action of hovering over it.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Final Answer: 2",Final Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He pushed at the doorbell.,The doorbell was pushed at by him.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: He pushed at the doorbell.
Hypothesis: The doorbell was pushed at by him.

1. **Check for Entailment (0)**:
   - The Hypothesis is a passive rephrasing of the Premise.
   - Both sentences convey the exact same action and meaning.
   - There is no additional information or change in context that would alter the truth value.

2. **Check for Neutral (1)**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or context that is not present in the Premise.
   - There is no ambiguity or uncertainty about the action described.

3. **Check for Contradiction (2)**:
   - There is no conflicting information between the Premise and the Hypothesis.
   - Both sentences describe the same event without any contradiction.

Given that the Hypothesis is simply a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the same meaning, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.",I had a mark on my body I needed to wash off.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.""
   - This indicates that the speaker used a washcloth to rub at a mark. The mark could be on any surface, not necessarily the body.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I had a mark on my body I needed to wash off.""
   - This suggests that the mark is specifically on the speaker's body and that the speaker needed to wash it off.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not specify where the mark is located. It could be on the body, but it could also be on any other surface (e.g., a wall, a piece of furniture, etc.).
   - The Hypothesis makes a specific claim about the mark being on the speaker's body.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm that the mark is on the speaker's body, the Hypothesis may or may not be true.
   - There is no direct contradiction, but there is also no definite confirmation.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.",I took a dry washcloth and hovered over the mark.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.""
Hypothesis: ""I took a dry washcloth and hovered over the mark.""

1. **Identify the actions in the Premise:**
   - The speaker took a washcloth.
   - The speaker wet the washcloth.
   - The speaker rubbed the wet washcloth at the mark.

2. **Identify the actions in the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker took a dry washcloth.
   - The speaker hovered the dry washcloth over the mark.

3. **Compare the actions:**
   - In the Premise, the washcloth is wet, and the action involves rubbing.
   - In the Hypothesis, the washcloth is dry, and the action involves hovering.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis are different from those in the Premise. The Premise involves a wet washcloth and rubbing, while the Hypothesis involves a dry washcloth and hovering.
   - These actions are mutually exclusive; if the washcloth is wet and being rubbed, it cannot simultaneously be dry and hovering.

Given these observations, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship is a contradiction.

conative,partial,"I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.",I rubbed at the mark with a wet washcloth.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.""
   - This sentence describes a sequence of actions: first, taking a washcloth, then wetting it, and finally rubbing at a mark.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I rubbed at the mark with a wet washcloth.""
   - This sentence describes the action of rubbing at a mark using a wet washcloth.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis states that the action of rubbing at the mark was done with a wet washcloth.
   - The Premise provides a detailed sequence leading to the same action: taking a washcloth, wetting it, and then rubbing at the mark.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is a concise version of the actions described in the Premise.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because the Premise explicitly states that the washcloth was wet before rubbing at the mark.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

The final output is:

conative,partial,He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.,He had a fresh bite on his neck.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.
Hypothesis: He had a fresh bite on his neck.

1. **Identify Key Information in the Premise:**
   - ""He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.""
   - Key points: ""rubbed,"" ""raw bite wound,"" ""throat.""

2. **Identify Key Information in the Hypothesis:**
   - ""He had a fresh bite on his neck.""
   - Key points: ""fresh bite,"" ""neck.""

3. **Compare the Key Information:**
   - The Premise mentions a ""raw bite wound"" on his ""throat.""
   - The Hypothesis mentions a ""fresh bite"" on his ""neck.""

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - ""Raw"" and ""fresh"" are synonymous in this context, both indicating a recent or new wound.
   - ""Throat"" is a part of the ""neck,"" so the locations are consistent.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because the descriptions of the wound and its location are consistent and synonymous.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.,His rubbing came nowhere close to the raw bite wound on his throat.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.""
   - This indicates that there is a person (he) who is actively rubbing a raw bite wound located on his throat.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""His rubbing came nowhere close to the raw bite wound on his throat.""
   - This suggests that the action of rubbing did not come near the raw bite wound on his throat.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the person is rubbing the raw bite wound on his throat.
   - The Hypothesis states that the rubbing did not come close to the raw bite wound on his throat.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis present directly opposing actions regarding the location of the rubbing in relation to the raw bite wound.
   - If the person is rubbing the raw bite wound (Premise), it is impossible for the rubbing to be nowhere close to the raw bite wound (Hypothesis).

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final Relation Output: 2",Final Relation Output: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.,His throat had a raw bite wound he rubbed at.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.""
   - This sentence indicates that there is a person (he) who has a raw bite wound located on his throat, and he is rubbing at it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""His throat had a raw bite wound he rubbed at.""
   - This sentence states that the person's throat has a raw bite wound, and he is rubbing at it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same situation: a person has a raw bite wound on his throat, and he is rubbing at it.
   - The information in the Hypothesis is directly supported by the information in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I rubbed at the ache in my neck.,I slept on my neck wrong.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""I rubbed at the ache in my neck.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker is experiencing some discomfort or pain in their neck and is trying to alleviate it by rubbing.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""I slept on my neck wrong.""
   - This statement suggests a possible cause for the neck ache, implying that the discomfort is due to an incorrect sleeping position.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the cause of the neck ache. It only states that there is an ache and the speaker is rubbing it.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a specific cause (sleeping wrong) for the neck ache, which is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - **Entailment (0):** The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise explicitly mentioned that the neck ache was due to sleeping wrong. However, the Premise does not provide this information.
   - **Neutral (1):** The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not rule out the possibility that the neck ache is due to sleeping wrong, but it also does not confirm it.
   - **Contradiction (2):** The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise provided a different cause for the neck ache. Since the Premise does not specify any cause, there is no contradiction.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is **Neutral (1)** because the Hypothesis is a plausible explanation for the neck ache, but it is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.

**Final Answer:**
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I rubbed at the ache in my neck.,I didn't touch my alleviated neck.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I rubbed at the ache in my neck.""
   - This implies that the speaker is experiencing an ache in their neck and is physically rubbing it to possibly alleviate the pain.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I didn't touch my alleviated neck.""
   - This implies that the speaker's neck is alleviated (no longer in pain) and that they did not touch it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the speaker is actively rubbing their neck, which means they are touching it.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker did not touch their neck, which directly contradicts the action described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis states that the speaker did not touch their neck, and the Premise states that the speaker did touch their neck by rubbing it, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final output:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,I rubbed at the ache in my neck.,I had an ache in my neck I rubbed at.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I rubbed at the ache in my neck.""
Hypothesis: ""I had an ache in my neck I rubbed at.""

1. **Check for Entailment (0):**
   - The Premise states that the speaker rubbed at an ache in their neck.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker had an ache in their neck and rubbed at it.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. Both statements convey the same information: the presence of an ache in the neck and the action of rubbing it.
   - Therefore, if the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must also be true.

2. **Check for Neutral (1):**
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that is not already present in the Premise.
   - There is no additional context or ambiguity that would make the Hypothesis possibly true or false independently of the Premise.

3. **Check for Contradiction (2):**
   - There is no information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.
   - Both statements are consistent with each other.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

conative,partial,Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.,Lily was wearing a decorated dress.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.""
   - This statement tells us that Lily is interacting with ribbons that are on her dress.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Lily was wearing a decorated dress.""
   - This statement suggests that Lily's dress has some form of decoration.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise explicitly mentions that there are ribbons on Lily's dress.
   - Ribbons are a form of decoration.
   - Therefore, if Lily's dress has ribbons, it can be inferred that her dress is decorated.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis ""Lily was wearing a decorated dress"" is definitely true based on the information provided in the Premise.

Thus, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.,Lily made no attempt to touch the ribbons on her dress.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.""
   - This means Lily actively touched and manipulated the ribbons on her dress.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Lily made no attempt to touch the ribbons on her dress.""
   - This means Lily did not touch or try to touch the ribbons on her dress.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Lily did touch the ribbons.
   - The Hypothesis states that Lily did not touch the ribbons.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If Lily plucked at the ribbons, she definitely made an attempt to touch them. Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.,There were ribbons on Lily's dress she plucked at.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.""
   - This statement tells us that Lily was interacting with ribbons that were on her dress.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""There were ribbons on Lily's dress she plucked at.""
   - This statement asserts that there were ribbons on Lily's dress, and she was plucking at them.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the information given in the Premise.
   - The Premise explicitly states that Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress, which directly implies that there were ribbons on her dress that she plucked at.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the information in the Premise, the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He stabbed at the last part of the equation.,The last part of the equation was the most complex.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He stabbed at the last part of the equation.""
   - This suggests that someone made an attempt or effort to solve or address the last part of an equation. The use of ""stabbed"" implies a possibly difficult or challenging task, but it does not provide any specific information about the complexity of the equation.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""The last part of the equation was the most complex.""
   - This statement asserts that the last part of the equation was the most complex part of the equation.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not provide any explicit information about the complexity of the last part of the equation. It only indicates that an effort was made to address it.
   - The Hypothesis makes a specific claim about the complexity of the last part of the equation, which is not directly supported or contradicted by the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the complexity of the last part of the equation, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is Neutral.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He stabbed at the last part of the equation.,He drew attention away from the last part of the equation.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He stabbed at the last part of the equation.""
   - This suggests that ""he"" made a forceful or aggressive action towards the last part of the equation. The word ""stabbed"" implies a physical or metaphorical action that is direct and possibly destructive.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He drew attention away from the last part of the equation.""
   - This suggests that ""he"" diverted focus or attention from the last part of the equation. The action described here is more about distraction or redirection rather than a direct or aggressive action.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an action directed at the last part of the equation, while the Hypothesis describes an action that diverts attention away from it.
   - These actions are fundamentally different: one is a direct action towards the equation, and the other is an action that moves focus away from it.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true because the actions described are contradictory. If ""he"" is stabbing at the last part of the equation, he is not drawing attention away from it; rather, he is focusing on it in a forceful manner.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He stabbed at the last part of the equation.,He made a stabbing gesture towards the last part of the equation.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He stabbed at the last part of the equation.""
   - This sentence suggests that ""he"" performed a stabbing action directed at the last part of an equation. The word ""stabbed"" can imply a physical action or a metaphorical one, but it is not explicitly clear from the premise alone.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He made a stabbing gesture towards the last part of the equation.""
   - This sentence suggests that ""he"" made a gesture that mimics stabbing, directed at the last part of an equation. The word ""gesture"" clarifies that the action is not literal but rather a mimicking motion.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that ""he stabbed"" at the last part of the equation, which could be interpreted as a literal or metaphorical action.
   - The Hypothesis clarifies that the action was a ""stabbing gesture,"" which aligns with the possible metaphorical interpretation of the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; instead, it provides a specific interpretation of the action described in the Premise.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because making a stabbing gesture is a plausible and specific interpretation of ""stabbing at"" something.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

conative,partial,I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.,I tried to drink the last bits of the slushee with my straw.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.""
Hypothesis: ""I tried to drink the last bits of the slushee with my straw.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The speaker removed the plastic dome from their drink.
   - The speaker then used a straw to stab at the slush in the drink.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker attempted to drink the remaining parts of the slushee using a straw.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The action of removing the plastic dome and stabbing at the slush with a straw suggests an attempt to access the remaining slush in the drink.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker tried to drink the last bits of the slushee, which aligns with the actions described in the Premise.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise. The actions described in the Premise (removing the dome and stabbing at the slush) are consistent with the intention of trying to drink the last bits of the slushee.
   - There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the Hypothesis.
   - The Hypothesis is a reasonable interpretation of the actions described in the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.,I kept the lid on my drink and slurped the slush with my straw.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.""
   - This indicates that the speaker removed the lid (plastic dome) from their drink and used the straw to stir or poke at the slush.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I kept the lid on my drink and slurped the slush with my straw.""
   - This indicates that the speaker did not remove the lid and instead used the straw to drink the slush.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the lid was removed, while the Hypothesis states that the lid was kept on.
   - These two actions are mutually exclusive; if the lid was removed, it cannot simultaneously be kept on.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis cannot both be true at the same time, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.,I stabbed at the slush with the straw after I took the lid off my drink.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: ""I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.""
Hypothesis: ""I stabbed at the slush with the straw after I took the lid off my drink.""

1. **Identify the actions in the Premise:**
   - Action 1: ""I took the plastic dome from my drink.""
   - Action 2: ""I stabbed at the slush with the straw.""

2. **Identify the actions in the Hypothesis:**
   - Action 1: ""I took the lid off my drink.""
   - Action 2: ""I stabbed at the slush with the straw.""

3. **Compare the actions and their sequence:**
   - The Premise states that the plastic dome (lid) was taken off first, and then the slush was stabbed with the straw.
   - The Hypothesis states that the lid was taken off first, and then the slush was stabbed with the straw.

4. **Check for consistency:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of actions: removing the lid first and then stabbing the slush with the straw.
   - The Hypothesis uses slightly different wording (""lid"" instead of ""plastic dome""), but the meaning is the same.

5. **Determine the relationship:**
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (both describe the same sequence of actions), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.","She enjoyed a cup of hot coffee, as it warmed her face and hands.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

### Premise:
""She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.""

### Hypothesis:
""She enjoyed a cup of hot coffee, as it warmed her face and hands.""

### Analysis:
1. **Action in Premise**: The woman took a cup, sipped the coffee, closed her eyes, and breathed in the steam.
2. **Action in Hypothesis**: The woman enjoyed a cup of hot coffee, and it warmed her face and hands.

### Key Points:
- **Enjoyment**: The Premise describes actions that suggest she is savoring the coffee (sipping, closing eyes, breathing in steam), which can imply enjoyment.
- **Temperature**: The Premise mentions steam, which indicates the coffee is hot.
- **Warming Effect**: The Hypothesis adds that the coffee warmed her face and hands, which is a reasonable extension given that hot coffee can have this effect.

### Conclusion:
- The Hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the Premise. The actions described in the Premise (sipping, closing eyes, breathing in steam) suggest she is enjoying the coffee, and the mention of steam indicates it is hot, which can warm her face and hands.
- There is no contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis.
- The Hypothesis is not merely possible but is strongly suggested by the Premise.

### Final Decision:
The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

### Relation:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.","She took the cold cup and didn't drink it, realizing her coffee was cold.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.""
   - This indicates that she took a cup of coffee, sipped it, and enjoyed the steam, suggesting the coffee is hot or warm.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She took the cold cup and didn't drink it, realizing her coffee was cold.""
   - This suggests that she took a cup of coffee, found it cold, and did not drink it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that she sipped the coffee and enjoyed the steam, implying the coffee was hot or warm.
   - The Hypothesis states that the coffee was cold and she did not drink it.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise implies the coffee is hot or warm (since she sipped it and enjoyed the steam), while the Hypothesis states the coffee is cold and she did not drink it.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.","She took the cup and closed her eyes, as she breathed in the steam of her cup of coffee she was sipping.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.
Hypothesis: She took the cup and closed her eyes, as she breathed in the steam of her cup of coffee she was sipping.

1. **Identify the actions and states in the Premise:**
   - She took the cup.
   - She sipped at the coffee.
   - She closed her eyes.
   - She breathed in the steam.

2. **Identify the actions and states in the Hypothesis:**
   - She took the cup.
   - She closed her eyes.
   - She breathed in the steam of her cup of coffee.
   - She was sipping.

3. **Compare the actions and states:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that she took the cup.
   - Both mention that she closed her eyes.
   - Both mention that she breathed in the steam.
   - Both mention that she was sipping the coffee.

4. **Check for consistency:**
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the actions and states described in the Premise without adding any new information or contradicting any details.
   - The sequence of actions in the Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise.

Since the Hypothesis restates the actions and states described in the Premise without adding or contradicting any information, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I sipped at the Heineken.,I had a bottle of beer.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""I sipped at the Heineken.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker drank from a Heineken, which is a brand of beer.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""I had a bottle of beer.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker had a bottle of beer.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Heineken is a type of beer, so if the speaker sipped at a Heineken, it implies that they had beer.
   - The premise does not explicitly state that the beer was in a bottle, but it is reasonable to infer that Heineken is commonly sold in bottles.
   - The hypothesis does not contradict the premise, and it is a reasonable assumption that if someone sipped at a Heineken, they likely had a bottle of beer.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The hypothesis is definitely true given the premise because sipping at a Heineken implies having beer, and it is common for Heineken to be in a bottle.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I sipped at the Heineken.,I spit out the Heineken.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""I sipped at the Heineken.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker took a small drink of the Heineken.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""I spit out the Heineken.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker expelled the Heineken from their mouth.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The act of sipping (taking a small drink) and spitting out (expelling the drink) are two different actions.
   - If someone sips a drink, it does not necessarily mean they will spit it out. They could swallow it instead.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis introduces a new action that is not implied by the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis introduces an action that is not necessarily true given the Premise, the relationship is not one of entailment.
   - The Hypothesis is not directly contradicted by the Premise either, as it is possible for someone to sip and then spit out a drink.
   - Thus, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I sipped at the Heineken.,I had some Heineken.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""I sipped at the Heineken.""
   - This indicates that the speaker took a small amount of Heineken, likely a beer, by sipping it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I had some Heineken.""
   - This suggests that the speaker consumed some amount of Heineken.

3. **Comparison**:
   - If someone sips at a drink, they are consuming some amount of it, even if it's a small amount.
   - Therefore, if the speaker sipped at the Heineken, it logically follows that they had some Heineken.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis ""I had some Heineken"" is definitely true given the Premise ""I sipped at the Heineken.""

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:

   - This indicates that the subject (he) participated in an activity involving raising a glass and sipping champagne in the company of others.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He toasted together with everyone using glasses of champagne.""
   - This suggests that the subject (he) participated in a toast with others, using glasses of champagne.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a social activity involving champagne and a group of people.
   - The act of raising a glass and sipping champagne can be reasonably interpreted as part of a toast.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise. Instead, it provides a plausible interpretation of the described action.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because raising a glass and sipping champagne with others is a common part of toasting.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.""
   - This indicates that the subject (he) participated in a toast or a similar activity by raising his glass and drinking champagne along with others.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He lowered his glass and didn't sip the champagne with everyone else.""
   - This suggests that the subject (he) did not participate in the toast or similar activity by lowering his glass and not drinking champagne, contrary to what others did.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that he raised his glass and sipped the champagne.
   - The Hypothesis states that he lowered his glass and did not sip the champagne.
   - These two actions are directly opposite to each other.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the actions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict the actions described in the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final output:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.,"With everyone else, he tasted the champagne and raised his glass.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.
Hypothesis: With everyone else, he tasted the champagne and raised his glass.

1. **Identify the actions and participants in the Premise:**
   - Actions: raised his glass, sipped at the champagne
   - Participants: he, everyone else

2. **Identify the actions and participants in the Hypothesis:**
   - Actions: tasted the champagne, raised his glass
   - Participants: he, everyone else

3. **Compare the actions and participants:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis involve the same actions (raising the glass and drinking champagne) and the same participants (he and everyone else).
   - The order of actions is slightly different, but the meaning remains the same.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the actions described in the Premise without changing the meaning.
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Phil nibbled at the cake.,Phil was too full for cake.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Phil nibbled at the cake.""
   - This indicates that Phil ate a small amount of cake.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Phil was too full for cake.""
   - This suggests that Phil did not eat any cake because he was too full.

3. **Analysis**:
   - If Phil nibbled at the cake, it means he ate at least a small amount of it.
   - If Phil was too full for cake, it implies that he did not eat any cake at all.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If Phil nibbled at the cake, he cannot be too full to eat any cake.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Phil nibbled at the cake.,Phil didn't try the cake.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""Phil nibbled at the cake.""
   - This statement indicates that Phil ate a small amount of the cake.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""Phil didn't try the cake.""
   - This statement indicates that Phil did not eat any of the cake.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise states that Phil ate a small amount of the cake.
   - The Hypothesis states that Phil did not eat any of the cake.

4. **Inference:**
   - If Phil nibbled at the cake, it means he did try the cake, even if it was just a small amount.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

**Relation Output: 2**",**Relation Output: 2**,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Phil nibbled at the cake.,Phil ate some cake.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise:** Phil nibbled at the cake.
2. **Hypothesis:** Phil ate some cake.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

- **Premise Analysis:** The action described is ""nibbled,"" which implies that Phil took small bites of the cake. This suggests that Phil did consume a portion of the cake, albeit in small amounts.
- **Hypothesis Analysis:** The statement ""Phil ate some cake"" indicates that Phil consumed a portion of the cake. It does not specify the amount or manner of consumption, just that some cake was eaten.

**Comparison:**
- The act of nibbling at the cake (Premise) inherently involves eating some of the cake, even if in small quantities.
- The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; rather, it is a broader statement that encompasses the action described in the Premise.

**Conclusion:**
- Since nibbling at the cake means that Phil did eat some cake, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.",He didn't realize how hungry he was for food.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.""
   - This suggests that the person started eating slowly or cautiously (nibbled) but then proceeded to eat with great hunger (ravenously).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He didn't realize how hungry he was for food.""
   - This suggests that the person was unaware of their own hunger until they started eating.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a change in eating behavior from nibbling to eating ravenously, which can imply that the person was indeed very hungry.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that the person was unaware of their hunger, which could explain the change in behavior described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a plausible explanation for the behavior described in the Premise. The Premise does not explicitly state the person's awareness of their hunger, but the described behavior (nibbling then eating ravenously) is consistent with someone who might not have realized how hungry they were initially.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. It is a reasonable inference but not definitively confirmed by the Premise alone.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.","He took big bites of the filet, then slowed down.",2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.""
   - This indicates that the person started by eating small amounts (nibbling) and then proceeded to eat with great hunger (ravenously).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He took big bites of the filet, then slowed down.""
   - This suggests that the person started by eating large amounts (big bites) and then reduced the pace of eating (slowed down).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a progression from eating small amounts to eating a lot quickly.
   - The Hypothesis describes a progression from eating a lot quickly to eating more slowly.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are opposite in terms of the sequence of eating behavior.
   - The Premise indicates an increase in eating intensity, while the Hypothesis indicates a decrease in eating intensity.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because they describe opposite sequences of eating behavior.

Therefore, the relationship is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.","He ate ravenously, after small bites of the filet.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.""
   - This indicates that the subject first took small bites of the filet and then proceeded to eat with great enthusiasm.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He ate ravenously, after small bites of the filet.""
   - This suggests that the subject ate ravenously following small bites of the filet.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of actions: small bites followed by ravenous eating.
   - The order of events is consistent between the Premise and the Hypothesis.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (both describe the same sequence of actions), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

conative,partial,"He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.","She had worn lipstick that day, not knowing she would be kissed.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.""
   - Key points: 
     - A kiss occurred.
     - The woman left lipstick behind.
     - The man brushed at the lipstick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She had worn lipstick that day, not knowing she would be kissed.""
   - Key points:
     - The woman wore lipstick.
     - She did not anticipate being kissed.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise confirms that the woman left lipstick behind, which implies she was wearing lipstick.
   - The Hypothesis states that she wore lipstick without knowing she would be kissed.
   - The Premise does not provide any information about her knowledge or expectations regarding the kiss.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis introduces an additional detail (her not knowing she would be kissed) that is not addressed in the Premise.
   - The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, but it also does not confirm the additional detail about her knowledge or expectations.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.",He didn't touch her because of the lipstick she had that would smear on him.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He kissed her in return"" indicates that there was a reciprocal action of kissing.
   - ""then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind"" suggests that after kissing, he noticed and tried to remove the lipstick mark she left on him.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He didn't touch her because of the lipstick she had that would smear on him"" implies that he avoided physical contact with her due to the potential of lipstick smearing on him.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that he did kiss her and then dealt with the lipstick mark.
   - The Hypothesis states that he avoided touching her because of the lipstick.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are directly contradictory. The Premise indicates physical contact (kissing), while the Hypothesis indicates avoidance of physical contact due to the lipstick.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the appropriate numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.","He wiped at the lipstick he knew she had left behind, after he had kissed her in return.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.""
Hypothesis: ""He wiped at the lipstick he knew she had left behind, after he had kissed her in return.""

1. **Identify the actions and their sequence in the Premise:**
   - Action 1: He kissed her in return.
   - Action 2: He brushed at the lipstick she had left behind.

2. **Identify the actions and their sequence in the Hypothesis:**
   - Action 1: He kissed her in return.
   - Action 2: He wiped at the lipstick she had left behind.

3. **Compare the actions and their sequence:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same two actions: kissing her in return and dealing with the lipstick she left behind.
   - The sequence of actions is the same in both: first, he kissed her in return, and then he dealt with the lipstick.
   - The difference in wording (""brushed"" vs. ""wiped"") does not change the overall meaning or the sequence of events.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis restates the actions described in the Premise with slightly different wording but does not introduce any new information or contradictions.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.",She had long hair past her shoulders that he moved away.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.""
   - This indicates that there is a man who is observing a woman's face and moving her hair, which is described as ""tumbled over her shoulders.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She had long hair past her shoulders that he moved away.""
   - This suggests that the woman has long hair that extends past her shoulders, and the man is moving this hair away.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes the hair as ""tumbled over her shoulders,"" which implies that the hair is long enough to reach or go past her shoulders.
   - The Hypothesis states that she had long hair past her shoulders, which is consistent with the description in the Premise.
   - The action of moving the hair away in the Hypothesis aligns with the action of brushing at the hair in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because the description of the hair and the action taken by the man are consistent and directly supported by the information in the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.",He didn't look her in the face or touch her hair that tumbled over her shoulders.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.""
Hypothesis: ""He didn't look her in the face or touch her hair that tumbled over her shoulders.""

1. **Identify the key actions in the Premise:**
   - ""He studied her face"" indicates that he looked at her face.
   - ""brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders"" indicates that he touched her hair.

2. **Identify the key actions in the Hypothesis:**
   - ""He didn't look her in the face"" directly contradicts ""He studied her face.""
   - ""or touch her hair that tumbled over her shoulders"" directly contradicts ""brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.""

3. **Compare the actions:**
   - The Hypothesis states that he did not perform the actions described in the Premise.
   - This is a direct contradiction because the Hypothesis negates both actions mentioned in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.","As he studied her face, he made a brushing movement at the hair tumbling over her shoulders.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.
Hypothesis: As he studied her face, he made a brushing movement at the hair tumbling over her shoulders.

1. **Identify the actions in the Premise:**
   - He studied her face.
   - He brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.

2. **Identify the actions in the Hypothesis:**
   - He studied her face.
   - He made a brushing movement at the hair tumbling over her shoulders.

3. **Compare the actions:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that he studied her face.
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that he brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.

4. **Check for consistency:**
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the actions described in the Premise but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis uses the phrase ""made a brushing movement,"" which is consistent with ""brushed at the hair"" in the Premise.

5. **Determine the relationship:**
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Someone hammered at the front door.,Someone was trying to get in the house.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Someone hammered at the front door.""
   - This statement indicates that there was a loud knocking or banging at the front door.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Someone was trying to get in the house.""
   - This statement suggests that the person knocking or banging was attempting to enter the house.

3. **Analysis**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the act of hammering at the front door must necessarily imply an attempt to enter the house. However, hammering at the door could be for various reasons, such as trying to get someone's attention without the intent to enter.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. Hammering at the door could be an attempt to get in, but it could also be for other reasons (e.g., delivering a message, warning someone, etc.).
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise explicitly stated that the person hammering at the door had no intention of entering the house. However, the Premise does not provide such information.

Given that the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude the intent behind the hammering, the most appropriate relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Someone hammered at the front door.,Someone didn't touch the front door.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

   - This statement indicates that an action (hammering) was performed on the front door by someone.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Someone didn't touch the front door.""
   - This statement indicates that no one made any physical contact with the front door.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that someone hammered at the front door, which implies physical contact with the door.
   - The Hypothesis states that no one touched the front door, which directly contradicts the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis directly contradicts the action described in the Premise, the relationship between the two statements is a contradiction.

Therefore, the appropriate numerical value for the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Someone hammered at the front door.,The front door was hammered by someone.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Hypothesis: The front door was hammered by someone.

1. **Identify the main action and subject in the Premise:**
   - Action: hammered
   - Subject: someone
   - Object: the front door

2. **Identify the main action and subject in the Hypothesis:**
   - Action: was hammered
   - Subject: the front door
   - Agent: by someone

3. **Compare the actions and subjects:**
   - The action ""hammered"" in the Premise is the same as ""was hammered"" in the Hypothesis, just in passive voice.
   - The subject ""someone"" in the Premise corresponds to the agent ""by someone"" in the Hypothesis.
   - The object ""the front door"" in the Premise is the subject in the Hypothesis.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise in passive voice. It conveys the same information without adding or contradicting any details.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.""
   - This indicates that Charles Powell is a spokesman and he is making a statement about not wanting anyone to be overlooked or neglected.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Charles Powell is a spokesman who is speaking on the behalf of others.""
   - This suggests that Charles Powell is a spokesman and implies that he is representing or speaking for others.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise explicitly mentions that Charles Powell is a spokesman.
   - The hypothesis also states that Charles Powell is a spokesman.
   - The hypothesis adds that he is speaking on behalf of others, which is a reasonable assumption given the role of a spokesman.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis does not introduce any information that contradicts the premise.
   - The hypothesis is consistent with the premise and can be reasonably inferred from it.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.""
   - This means that the spokesman, Charles Powell, is expressing a desire to prevent people from slipping through the cracks.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""We want people to slip through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.""
   - This implies that the spokesman, Charles Powell, is expressing a desire for people to slip through the cracks.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise explicitly states a negative intention (""don't want anyone to slip through the cracks"").
   - The hypothesis states the opposite intention (""want people to slip through the cracks"").

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise because it states the exact opposite of what the premise states.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.""
   - This indicates that Charles Powell, a spokesman, made a statement expressing a desire to prevent people from being overlooked or neglected.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Spokesman Charles Powell had said, 'We don't want anyone to slip through the cracks.'""
   - This is a direct quotation attributed to Charles Powell, indicating that he made the same statement as in the Premise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The content of the Hypothesis is essentially a direct restatement of the Premise.
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same information: Charles Powell, a spokesman, expressed a desire to prevent people from slipping through the cracks.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a direct restatement of the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.,There is a river called the Weantic River.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.
Hypothesis: There is a river called the Weantic River.

1. **Identify the key information in the Premise:**
   - The Weweantic River is mentioned.
   - The river flows through a pond.

2. **Identify the key information in the Hypothesis:**
   - There is a river called the Weantic River.

3. **Compare the information:**
   - The Premise explicitly mentions the Weweantic River.
   - The Hypothesis states that there is a river called the Weantic River.

4. **Check for consistency:**
   - The Premise provides information about the existence of the Weweantic River.
   - The Hypothesis is asserting the existence of a river called the Weantic River.

5. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Premise confirms the existence of the Weweantic River.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of part of the information in the Premise, though it slightly misspells the name as ""Weantic"" instead of ""Weweantic.""

Given that the Hypothesis is a slightly misspelled version of the river's name mentioned in the Premise, it is reasonable to infer that the Hypothesis is true based on the Premise, despite the minor spelling error.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.,The Weweantic River does not flow through the pond.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

   - This statement asserts that the Weweantic River flows through the pond.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The Weweantic River does not flow through the pond.""
   - This statement asserts that the Weweantic River does not flow through the pond.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the river flows through the pond.
   - The Hypothesis states that the river does not flow through the pond.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the Premise is true, the Hypothesis cannot be true, and vice versa.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.,Water from the Weweantic River moves through the pond.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.
Hypothesis: Water from the Weweantic River moves through the pond.

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - **Premise:** The Weweantic River flows through the pond.
   - **Hypothesis:** Water from the Weweantic River moves through the pond.

2. **Compare Key Elements:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the Weweantic River and the pond.
   - The Premise states that the river ""flows"" through the pond.
   - The Hypothesis states that ""water from the Weweantic River moves"" through the pond.

3. **Determine Semantic Equivalence:**
   - The term ""flows"" in the Premise implies movement of water.
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states that water from the river ""moves"" through the pond.
   - Both statements describe the same scenario: water from the river moving through the pond.

4. **Evaluate the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise using slightly different wording.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis.
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.,In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital to appeal for an end to prescription drug abuse.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.""
   - Key points: 
     - Location: Cambodia, capital Phnom Penh
     - Action: Several hundred people marched
     - Purpose: To appeal for an end to growing drug use

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital to appeal for an end to prescription drug abuse.""
   - Key points:
     - Location: Cambodia, capital (Phnom Penh is implied but not explicitly mentioned)
     - Action: Several hundred people marched
     - Purpose: To appeal for an end to prescription drug abuse

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention a march in Cambodia's capital.
   - The number of people marching is the same in both statements.
   - The purpose of the march differs slightly:
     - Premise: To appeal for an end to growing drug use (general)
     - Hypothesis: To appeal for an end to prescription drug abuse (specific type of drug use)

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis specifies a particular type of drug abuse (prescription drug abuse), which is a subset of the broader category mentioned in the Premise (growing drug use).
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise because the Premise does not specify the type of drug use. It is possible that the march was specifically about prescription drug abuse, but it is not certain from the information given.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

intransitive-motion,schematic,In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.,In Cambodia few people walked through the capital Phnom Penh to deny an end to growing drug use.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

### Premise:
""In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.""

### Hypothesis:
""In Cambodia few people walked through the capital Phnom Penh to deny an end to growing drug use.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Quantifier Analysis:**
   - Premise: ""several hundred people""
   - Hypothesis: ""few people""
   - The quantifiers are different. ""Several hundred"" implies a large number, while ""few"" implies a small number. This is a significant difference.

2. **Action Analysis:**
   - Premise: ""MARCHED""
   - Hypothesis: ""walked""
   - ""Marched"" implies a more organized and purposeful movement, often associated with protests or demonstrations, while ""walked"" is a more general term. This difference is notable but not necessarily contradictory.

3. **Purpose Analysis:**
   - Premise: ""to appeal for an end to growing drug use""
   - Hypothesis: ""to deny an end to growing drug use""
   - The purposes are directly opposite. The Premise indicates that the people are appealing for an end to drug use, while the Hypothesis suggests they are denying an end to drug use. This is a direct contradiction.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise in terms of the number of people involved and the purpose of their action. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

### Final Relation Output:

intransitive-motion,schematic,In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.,Several hundred people marched to appeal the end of growing drug use in Cambodia through the capital Phnom Penh.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.""

### Hypothesis:
""Several hundred people marched to appeal the end of growing drug use in Cambodia through the capital Phnom Penh.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Subject and Action Consistency**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention ""several hundred people"" who ""marched.""
   - The action of marching is consistent in both statements.

2. **Purpose of the March**:
   - Both statements indicate that the purpose of the march was to appeal for an end to growing drug use.
   - The purpose is clearly stated and matches in both the Premise and the Hypothesis.

3. **Location**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis specify that the march took place ""through the capital Phnom Penh.""
   - The location is consistent in both statements.

4. **Additional Context**:
   - The Premise provides the context that this event happened in Cambodia, which is also mentioned in the Hypothesis.
   - There is no additional context in the Hypothesis that contradicts or adds to the information given in the Premise.

### Conclusion:
- The Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details.
- Given the consistency in subject, action, purpose, and location, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

### Final Decision:
0 – Entailment

The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

intransitive-motion,schematic,In VERY vivid detail I remember FALLING down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door.,"The speaker had great memory of events, but not great balance since they fell down the stairs like that.",1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker vividly remembers falling down the first flight of stairs in their house onto the landing in front of the main door.
   - Key points: vivid memory, falling down stairs, specific location (first flight of stairs, landing in front of the main door).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The speaker had great memory of events.
   - The speaker did not have great balance since they fell down the stairs.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The first part of the Hypothesis (""The speaker had great memory of events"") is supported by the Premise, which mentions ""VERY vivid detail"" of the event.
   - The second part of the Hypothesis (""not great balance since they fell down the stairs"") is an inference based on the fact that the speaker fell down the stairs. However, the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the speaker generally has poor balance. The fall could have been a one-time incident or due to other factors.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The first part of the Hypothesis is entailed by the Premise.
   - The second part of the Hypothesis is not directly supported or contradicted by the Premise; it is an additional inference that may or may not be true.

Given that the Hypothesis includes an additional inference that is not definitively supported or contradicted by the Premise, the overall relationship is best described as Neutral.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker vividly remembers falling down the first flight of stairs in their house onto the landing in front of the main door.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The speaker does not remember at all falling down the first flight of stairs in their house onto the landing in front of the main door.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker has a very vivid memory of the event.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker has no memory of the event.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis are directly contradictory. If the speaker vividly remembers the event, it cannot be true that they do not remember it at all.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker remembers falling down the first flight of stairs in their house.
   - The fall ended on the landing in front of the main door.
   - The memory is described as being in very vivid detail.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The speaker fell down the first flight of stairs in their house.
   - The fall ended on the landing in front of the main door.
   - The speaker remembers the event in very vivid detail.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: falling down the first flight of stairs onto the landing in front of the main door.
   - Both mention that the memory of the event is in very vivid detail.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details.
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is one of Entailment.

intransitive-motion,schematic,"People who SPILLED over from the ""protest"" attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.",An innocent person was driving down Regent Street when their car was attacked by protestors.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""People who SPILLED over from the 'protest' attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.""

### Hypothesis:
""An innocent person was driving down Regent Street when their car was attacked by protestors.""

### Analysis:
1. **Premise Details**:
   - The premise states that people from a protest attacked a car on Regent Street.
   - It does not specify who was driving the car or the nature of the driver (innocent or otherwise).

2. **Hypothesis Details**:
   - The hypothesis adds the detail that the person driving the car was innocent.
   - It also states that the car was attacked by protestors, which aligns with the premise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise confirms that a car was attacked by protestors on Regent Street.
   - The hypothesis introduces the idea that the driver was innocent, which is not mentioned in the premise.

### Conclusion:
- The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise because the premise does not provide information about the innocence of the driver.
- Therefore, the hypothesis is not definitely true (Entailment) nor definitely false (Contradiction) based on the given premise.

### Final Decision:
The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

(AMR)",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""People who SPILLED over from the 'protest' attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.""
   - Key points: People from the protest attacked the car.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""People who spilled over from the 'protest' quietly watched their car as it went down Regent Street.""
   - Key points: People from the protest quietly watched the car.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the people attacked the car.
   - The Hypothesis states that the people quietly watched the car.
   - Attacking and quietly watching are mutually exclusive actions. If people are attacking the car, they cannot be quietly watching it at the same time.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis cannot both be true simultaneously, the Hypothesis contradicts the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"People who SPILLED over from the ""protest"" attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.","Their car was attacked by people who spilled over from the ""protest"" as it went down Regent Street.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: People who SPILLED over from the ""protest"" attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.
Hypothesis: Their car was attacked by people who spilled over from the ""protest"" as it went down Regent Street.

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - **Premise:** People who spilled over from the protest attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.
   - **Hypothesis:** Their car was attacked by people who spilled over from the protest as it went down Regent Street.

2. **Compare the Statements:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention ""people who spilled over from the protest.""
   - Both statements indicate that these people attacked ""their car.""
   - Both statements specify the location as ""Regent Street.""
   - Both statements describe the event happening ""as it went down Regent Street.""

3. **Check for Consistency:**
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise with no additional information or contradictions.
   - The meaning and the details in both the Premise and the Hypothesis are identical.

4. **Determine the Inference Relation:**
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.",Marchers will proceed on Market until they reach the capital building.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.""
   - This indicates a specific route that the marchers will take: starting on Pine St., then moving to Broadway, and finally proceeding to Market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that ""Marchers will proceed on Market until they reach the capital building.""
   - This suggests that the marchers will continue on Market Street until they arrive at the capital building.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not mention anything about the marchers' destination after reaching Market Street. It only specifies the route up to Market Street.
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information by stating that the marchers will continue on Market Street until they reach the capital building.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny that the marchers will proceed to the capital building after reaching Market Street.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is not definitely true (Entailment) nor definitely false (Contradiction) based on the information given in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.",Marchers will stop at Pine St and not continue to Broadway nor Market.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.""
   - This indicates a sequence of movement: starting on Pine St., then moving to Broadway, and finally to Market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that ""Marchers will stop at Pine St and not continue to Broadway nor Market.""
   - This suggests that the marchers will halt their movement at Pine St. and will not proceed to the subsequent locations mentioned in the Premise (Broadway and Market).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a continuous movement through multiple streets.
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that the marchers will stop at the first street (Pine St.) and not continue to the other streets (Broadway and Market).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis states that the marchers will stop at Pine St. and not proceed further, it directly contradicts the Premise, which states that the marchers will continue to Broadway and Market.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.","From Pine St., to Broadway, then to Market marchers will continue.",0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.""
   - This indicates a sequence of streets the marchers will follow: starting on Pine St., then moving to Broadway, and finally to Market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""From Pine St., to Broadway, then to Market marchers will continue.""
   - This also describes a sequence of streets the marchers will follow: starting on Pine St., then moving to Broadway, and finally to Market.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of streets: Pine St. to Broadway to Market.
   - The wording is different, but the meaning is identical.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they describe the same route in the same order), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to march around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis on Tuesday, Sept. 24th.
   - Key details: 
     - Participants: Mine workers and supporters
     - Action: Plan to march
     - Location: Headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis
     - Date: Tuesday, Sept. 24th

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that mine workers and supporters are protesting for fair wages at Peabody Energy in St. Louis on Tuesday, Sept. 24th.
   - Key details:
     - Participants: Mine workers and supporters
     - Action: Protesting for fair wages
     - Location: Peabody Energy in St. Louis
     - Date: Tuesday, Sept. 24th

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis mention the same participants (mine workers and supporters), the same location (Peabody Energy in St. Louis), and the same date (Tuesday, Sept. 24th).
   - The main difference lies in the action described:
     - Premise: Plan to march
     - Hypothesis: Protesting for fair wages

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The premise does not specify the reason for the march, only that a march is planned.
   - The hypothesis adds the detail that the march is a protest for fair wages.
   - Since the premise does not provide information about the purpose of the march, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true or false based on the premise alone.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to MARCH around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.","No mine workers or supporters plan to march around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to MARCH around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.""
   - This statement asserts that a large number of mine workers and supporters have plans to march around a specific location on a specific date.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""No mine workers or supporters plan to march around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.""
   - This statement asserts that there are no plans for any mine workers or supporters to march around the same location on the same date.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to march.
   - The Hypothesis states that no mine workers or supporters plan to march.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the Premise is true (that thousands plan to march), then the Hypothesis (that no one plans to march) cannot be true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to MARCH around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.""
   - Key information: 
     - Thousands of mine workers and supporters
     - Plan to march
     - Around the headquarters of Peabody Energy
     - In St. Louis
     - This coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""This coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th at Peabody Energy in St. Louis thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to march around the headquarters.""
   - Key information:
     - This coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th
     - At Peabody Energy in St. Louis
     - Thousands of mine workers and supporters
     - Plan to march
     - Around the headquarters

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis contain the same key information.
   - The order of the information is slightly different, but the content is identical.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that is not present in the Premise.
   - There is no information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they convey the exact same information), the relation is **Entailment**.

Therefore, the relation is:

### Premise:
""He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, FLASHED across the sand.""

### Hypothesis:
""The man had visited a totally different planet covered in sand that had looked like the wrong one, when a light flashed across the sand.""

### Analysis:
1. **Subject Identification**:
   - **Premise**: ""He"" (a man) is afraid he is on the wrong planet.
   - **Hypothesis**: ""The man"" (same individual) visited a different planet covered in sand.

2. **Event Description**:
   - **Premise**: The man is afraid he is on the wrong planet, and then he sees a coil of gold flashing across the sand.
   - **Hypothesis**: The man visited a different planet covered in sand, which looked like the wrong one, and then a light flashed across the sand.

3. **Key Details**:
   - **Premise**: The man is currently on a planet and sees a coil of gold flashing.
   - **Hypothesis**: The man has visited a different planet covered in sand, which he thought was the wrong one, and then a light flashed.

4. **Temporal and Contextual Consistency**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state that the man has visited multiple planets; it only mentions his fear of being on the wrong planet.
   - The Hypothesis introduces the idea of visiting a ""totally different planet"" and describes it as covered in sand, which is not mentioned in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis also mentions a light flashing, which is somewhat consistent with the ""coil of gold"" flashing in the Premise, but the contexts differ.

### Conclusion:
- The Hypothesis introduces new information (visiting a different planet) that is not present in the Premise.
- The Hypothesis is not directly contradicted by the Premise, but it is also not definitively supported by it.
- The relationship between the Premise and Hypothesis is such that the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

### Final Decision:
1 – Neutral

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - Premise: The subject ""he"" was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet.
   - Hypothesis: The subject ""he"" was not afraid that he had come to the wrong planet.

2. **Compare the Statements:**
   - The Premise states that the subject was beginning to be afraid.
   - The Hypothesis states that the subject was not afraid.

3. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis present directly opposing states of mind regarding the subject's fear about being on the wrong planet.
   - The Premise indicates the presence of fear, while the Hypothesis indicates the absence of fear.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise, it cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, FLASHED across the sand.""
   - This sentence describes a situation where someone is feeling fear about being on the wrong planet, and at that moment, a coil of gold, which is the color of moonlight, flashes across the sand.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""A coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand as he was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet.""
   - This sentence describes the same situation but rephrased. It states that a coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand while he was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event with the same details: a coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashing across the sand while someone is beginning to be afraid they are on the wrong planet.
   - The order of the clauses is slightly different, but the meaning remains unchanged.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis restates the Premise with no additional information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,I RAN around the track.,I run professionally.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I RAN around the track.""
   - This indicates that the speaker engaged in running around a track at some point in the past.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I run professionally.""
   - This suggests that the speaker runs as a profession, implying regular and possibly competitive running.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a single instance of running around a track.
   - The Hypothesis describes a habitual or professional activity related to running.

4. **Inference**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise would need to indicate that the speaker runs professionally. However, the Premise only mentions a single instance of running, which does not necessarily imply professional running.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the professional aspect of running. It is possible that someone who ran around a track could be a professional runner, but it is also possible that they are not.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: There is no information in the Premise that directly contradicts the Hypothesis. The Premise does not state anything that would make it impossible for the speaker to run professionally.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as Neutral.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,I RAN around the track.,I walked around the track.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""I RAN around the track.""
   - The action described is ""ran,"" which implies moving quickly on foot.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I walked around the track.""
   - The action described is ""walked,"" which implies moving at a slower pace on foot compared to running.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Running and walking are two different actions with different speeds.
   - If someone ran around the track, it directly contradicts the statement that they walked around the track because one cannot simultaneously run and walk at the same time.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the actions ""ran"" and ""walked"" are mutually exclusive in this context, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final output:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,I RAN around the track.,I circled the track by running.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I RAN around the track.""
   - This means the speaker performed the action of running around a track.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I circled the track by running.""
   - This means the speaker circled (went around) the track using the action of running.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action: running around a track.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they describe the same event in different words), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""I DROVE through the tunnel.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker was driving and went through a tunnel.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I was driving in my car.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker was driving a car.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that the speaker drove through a tunnel, which implies that the speaker was driving.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker was driving in their car.

4. **Inference**:
   - Given that the Premise states the speaker drove through a tunnel, it is reasonable to infer that the speaker was driving a car. The act of driving through a tunnel typically involves being in a vehicle, most commonly a car.
   - There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the Hypothesis. In fact, the Premise supports the Hypothesis.

Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

**Relation Output**: 0",**Relation Output**: 0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DROVE through the tunnel.,I avoided the tunnel.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""I DROVE through the tunnel.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker traveled through the tunnel by driving.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I avoided the tunnel.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker did not go through the tunnel.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker drove through the tunnel.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker avoided the tunnel.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - If the speaker drove through the tunnel, it is impossible for the speaker to have avoided the tunnel at the same time.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

intransitive-motion,schematic,I DROVE through the tunnel.,I went throught the tunnel by driving.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I DROVE through the tunnel.""
Hypothesis: ""I went through the tunnel by driving.""

1. **Identify the main action in the Premise:**
   - The main action is ""drove through the tunnel.""

2. **Identify the main action in the Hypothesis:**
   - The main action is ""went through the tunnel by driving.""

3. **Compare the actions and context:**
   - The action ""drove"" in the Premise is synonymous with ""went through the tunnel by driving"" in the Hypothesis.
   - Both statements describe the same event: traveling through the tunnel by driving.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis restates the Premise in different words but conveys the same meaning.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,We DROVE past the hotel.,We DROVE all the way to the next city.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""We DROVE past the hotel.""
   - This statement indicates that the action of driving occurred and that the driving took place past a specific location, the hotel.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""We DROVE all the way to the next city.""
   - This statement suggests that the driving continued until reaching a different, more distant location, specifically another city.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise only mentions driving past the hotel, which is a specific point in the journey.
   - The Hypothesis extends the journey to a much farther destination, the next city.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm that the driving continued all the way to the next city. It only confirms driving past the hotel.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information given in the Premise. There is no contradiction, but there is also no definite confirmation.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,We DROVE past the hotel.,We drove straight to the hotel.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""We DROVE past the hotel.""
   - This indicates that the action of driving occurred and the hotel was a landmark that was passed by during the drive.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""We drove straight to the hotel.""
   - This suggests that the destination of the drive was the hotel and that the route taken was direct.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the hotel was passed by, implying that the hotel was not the final destination or that the route did not end at the hotel.
   - The Hypothesis states that the hotel was the final destination and that the route was direct to the hotel.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because driving past the hotel contradicts the idea of driving straight to the hotel.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the relation is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,We DROVE past the hotel.,We were driving when we went past the hotel.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: We DROVE past the hotel.
Hypothesis: We were driving when we went past the hotel.

1. **Identify the main action in the Premise:**
   - The main action is ""drove past the hotel.""

2. **Identify the main action in the Hypothesis:**
   - The main action is ""were driving when we went past the hotel.""

3. **Compare the actions and context:**
   - The Premise states that ""we drove past the hotel,"" which implies that the action of driving occurred as we passed the hotel.
   - The Hypothesis states that ""we were driving when we went past the hotel,"" which essentially describes the same scenario: driving while passing the hotel.

4. **Determine if the Hypothesis is definitely true, possibly true, or definitely false given the Premise:**
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise. Both statements describe the same event of driving past the hotel.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or adds uncertainty to the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.,The plane flew to its destination of California.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.""
   - This indicates that the plane was in flight and its path included flying over the Grand Canyon.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The plane flew to its destination of California.""
   - This suggests that the plane's final destination was California.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the plane's final destination. It only mentions that the plane flew over the Grand Canyon.
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information about the plane's destination being California, which is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not confirm or deny the destination of the plane, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the given Premise.
   - There is no direct contradiction or confirmation between the Premise and the Hypothesis.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Final output:
1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.,The plane didn't pass over the Grand Canyon.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.""
   - This statement indicates that the plane traveled through the air above the Grand Canyon.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The plane didn't pass over the Grand Canyon.""
   - This statement asserts that the plane did not travel above the Grand Canyon.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the plane flew over the Grand Canyon.
   - The Hypothesis states that the plane did not pass over the Grand Canyon.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the plane flew over the Grand Canyon, it necessarily means that it passed over it.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

**Conclusion**: The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

**Relation Output**: 2",**Relation Output**: 2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.,The plane was flying when it went over the Grand Canyon.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.""
   - This statement indicates that at some point in the past, a plane traveled through the air above the Grand Canyon.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The plane was flying when it went over the Grand Canyon.""
   - This statement suggests that the plane was in the act of flying as it passed over the Grand Canyon.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that the plane ""flew"" over the Grand Canyon, which inherently means that the plane was in the act of flying when it went over the Grand Canyon.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases this by stating that the plane ""was flying"" when it went over the Grand Canyon.
   - Both statements describe the same event and imply the same action (the plane being in flight over the Grand Canyon).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true. The action described in the Hypothesis is directly entailed by the action described in the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .,I pass by Watkins Landing on my way into work and back home.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This means the speaker drives by Watkins Landing twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I pass by Watkins Landing on my way into work and back home.""
   - This implies the speaker passes by Watkins Landing during their commute to work and back home.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker drives past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker passes by Watkins Landing on their way to work and back home.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the speaker drives past Watkins Landing every morning and evening, it is reasonable to infer that this could be part of their daily commute to work in the morning and back home in the evening.
   - There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the Hypothesis. In fact, the Premise supports the Hypothesis by providing a plausible explanation for why the speaker drives past Watkins Landing at those times.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .,I avoid going past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker drives past a specific location, Watkins Landing, twice a day.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I avoid going past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker makes a conscious effort to not go past Watkins Landing at the same times mentioned in the premise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker drives past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker avoids going past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the speaker drives past Watkins Landing every morning and evening, it directly contradicts the idea that the speaker avoids going past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

intransitive-motion,schematic,I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .,My driving route goes past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker drives past a specific location, Watkins Landing, twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""My driving route goes past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker's driving route includes passing by Watkins Landing twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action: driving past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise without adding or contradicting any information.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail .,I commute by bike to stay healthy and enjoy the views from the Huguenot Trail.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail.""
   - This indicates that the speaker regularly travels to and from work using the Huguenot Trail.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I commute by bike to stay healthy and enjoy the views from the Huguenot Trail.""
   - This suggests that the speaker uses a bike for commuting, with the additional motivations of staying healthy and enjoying the views.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not specify the mode of commuting (e.g., bike, car, walking).
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional details (commuting by bike, staying healthy, enjoying views) that are not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude the Hypothesis. Since the Premise does not specify the mode of commuting or the motivations, we cannot definitively conclude the Hypothesis from the Premise.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, but it also does not provide enough information to confirm it. The additional details in the Hypothesis are plausible but not guaranteed by the Premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that directly conflicts with the Hypothesis. There is no such conflict here; the Premise is silent on the mode of commuting and motivations.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail .,I go around the Hugenot Trail as I go back and forth to work.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail.""
Hypothesis: ""I go around the Huguenot Trail as I go back and forth to work.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The speaker commutes to work.
   - The commuting route is specifically on the Huguenot Trail.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The speaker goes around the Huguenot Trail.
   - This action is also in the context of commuting back and forth to work.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise states that the commuting route is on the Huguenot Trail.
   - The Hypothesis states that the commuting route involves going around the Huguenot Trail.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - If the speaker commutes on the Huguenot Trail, it implies they are using the trail directly.
   - If the speaker goes around the Huguenot Trail, it implies they are not using the trail directly but rather avoiding it or taking a different route.

5. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis suggests a different commuting route compared to the Premise.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Final Relation Output: 2",Final Relation Output: 2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail .,I take the Hugenot Trail back and forth to work.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail.""
Hypothesis: ""I take the Hugenot Trail back and forth to work.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The speaker commutes to work using the Huguenot Trail.
   - The phrase ""back and forth"" indicates a round trip, implying the speaker uses the Huguenot Trail both to and from work.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker takes the Huguenot Trail to and from work.
   - The phrase ""back and forth"" similarly indicates a round trip.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action: commuting to work using the Huguenot Trail.
   - The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is identical.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they both describe the same commuting action using the Huguenot Trail), the relationship is one of entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

   - They made plans to arrest him on gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that Dade County and federal authorities made plans to arrest him on gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.
   - The additional information in the Hypothesis is that these authorities are famous for daring arrests.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The additional detail in the Hypothesis about the authorities being famous for daring arrests is not present in the Premise.
   - This detail does not contradict the Premise, nor does it necessarily follow from the Premise. It is additional information that may or may not be true based on the given Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Dade County and federal authorities, learning that he intended to FLY through Miami, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.""
   - This means that the authorities were aware of his intention to fly through Miami and, based on this information, they made plans to arrest him.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Dade County and federal authorities, didn't know that he intended to FLY through Miami, so they didn't make plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.""
   - This suggests that the authorities were not aware of his intention to fly through Miami and, as a result, did not make any plans to arrest him.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the authorities knew about his intention and made plans to arrest him.
   - The Hypothesis states the opposite: that the authorities did not know about his intention and therefore did not make plans to arrest him.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise. The Premise says the authorities knew and made plans, while the Hypothesis says they did not know and did not make plans.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Oguz mentions that anyone flying over major opium-producing areas would see a lot of small fires in the mountains.
   - These small fires are identified as heroin labs.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that major opium-producing areas that house heroin labs can be spotted by looking for small fires from high above.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise provides specific information that flying over opium-producing areas reveals small fires, which are heroin labs.
   - The hypothesis generalizes this information by stating that these areas can be spotted by looking for small fires from high above.

4. **Inference**:
   - The hypothesis is a restatement of the premise in a more general form. It does not introduce new information or contradict the premise.
   - The hypothesis logically follows from the premise because if anyone flying over these areas sees small fires (heroin labs), then it is reasonable to conclude that these areas can be spotted by looking for small fires from high above.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Each year, over 50,000 migratory birds FLY over Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here.""
   - This statement provides information about the migratory behavior of birds, specifically that they fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose to roost there for the winter.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Each year, over 50,000 migratory birds FLY over Hong Kong's skyscrapers and have inspired beautiful art for generations.""
   - This statement mentions the same migratory behavior of birds but adds an additional claim that these birds have inspired beautiful art for generations.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis both agree on the fact that over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers each year.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new piece of information: that these birds have inspired beautiful art for generations. This information is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The additional information in the Hypothesis (inspiring beautiful art) is not directly supported or contradicted by the Premise. The Premise does not provide any information about the birds inspiring art.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Premise: Each year, over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here.

Hypothesis: Each year, over 50,000 migratory birds go around Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose to not roost for winter here.

1. **Compare the actions of the birds:**
   - Premise: The birds fly over the skyscrapers.
   - Hypothesis: The birds go around the skyscrapers.
   - These actions are different but not necessarily contradictory. However, they indicate different paths taken by the birds.

2. **Compare the roosting behavior:**
   - Premise: The birds choose to roost for winter in Hong Kong.
   - Hypothesis: The birds choose not to roost for winter in Hong Kong.
   - These behaviors are directly contradictory. The Premise states that the birds roost in Hong Kong, while the Hypothesis states that they do not.

Given that the Hypothesis directly contradicts the roosting behavior described in the Premise, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the relation is:
2",2,False,False,True,2

**Premise:** Each year, over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here.

**Hypothesis:** Over 50,000 migratory birds choose to roost for winter each year as they fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers.

1. **Content Comparison:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention ""over 50,000 migratory birds.""
   - Both state that these birds ""fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers.""
   - Both indicate that these birds ""choose to roost for winter"" in Hong Kong.

2. **Temporal Aspect:**
   - The Premise specifies that this event happens ""each year.""
   - The Hypothesis also specifies that this event happens ""each year.""

3. **Logical Flow:**
   - The Premise states that the birds fly over the skyscrapers and then choose to roost for winter.
   - The Hypothesis states that the birds choose to roost for winter as they fly over the skyscrapers.

4. **Rephrasing:**
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with the same meaning. The order of actions (flying over skyscrapers and choosing to roost) is slightly different in wording but does not change the overall meaning.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise with no additional information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

**Conclusion:**
The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

   - This statement directly states that the individuals in question are not understanding the point.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The idiom ""flying right over your head"" and the statement ""not understanding the point"" convey the same meaning.
   - The Hypothesis is a direct interpretation of the idiomatic expression used in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (as it is a direct explanation of the idiom), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,But it's all FLYING right over your head.,But it's all sticking in your head.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""But it's all FLYING right over your head.""
   - This phrase suggests that the information or content is not being understood or grasped by the person. It implies a lack of comprehension or retention.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""But it's all sticking in your head.""
   - This phrase suggests that the information or content is being understood and retained by the person. It implies comprehension and retention.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a lack of understanding or retention.
   - The Hypothesis indicates understanding and retention.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis present opposite situations regarding the comprehension and retention of information.
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise, it cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final output:

intransitive-motion,schematic,But it's all FLYING right over your head.,But it's all going right over your head.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""But it's all FLYING right over your head.""
Hypothesis: ""But it's all going right over your head.""

1. **Lexical Analysis**:
   - The key difference between the Premise and the Hypothesis is the word ""FLYING"" in the Premise and ""going"" in the Hypothesis.
   - Both ""FLYING"" and ""going"" can be used metaphorically to indicate that something is not being understood or is being missed.

2. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The phrase ""right over your head"" in both the Premise and Hypothesis suggests that the subject is not comprehending something.
   - The use of ""FLYING"" versus ""going"" does not change the overall meaning significantly. Both imply that the information is not being grasped.

3. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - The context provided by the Premise and Hypothesis is consistent. The metaphorical use of ""FLYING"" and ""going"" both convey the same idea of missing or not understanding something.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - Since the Hypothesis ""But it's all going right over your head"" is definitely true given the Premise ""But it's all FLYING right over your head,"" there is no contradiction or uncertainty.

Based on the analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

intransitive-motion,schematic,"It will be like you're FLOATING along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.",Quitting smoking may imrove your ability to swim and complete other cardiovascular exercises.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise describes a situation where a person feels like they are floating along fine, but then suddenly experiences a strong urge to smoke.
   - This suggests a struggle with quitting smoking, where the urge to smoke can come unexpectedly and strongly.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that quitting smoking may improve one's ability to swim and complete other cardiovascular exercises.
   - This is a general statement about the benefits of quitting smoking on physical fitness and cardiovascular health.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise is focused on the experience of sudden urges to smoke while trying to quit.
   - The Hypothesis is about the potential health benefits of quitting smoking, specifically related to cardiovascular exercises.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the health benefits of quitting smoking or its impact on cardiovascular exercises.
   - The Hypothesis is a general statement that could be true, but it is not directly supported or contradicted by the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,"It will be like you're FLOATING along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.","It will be like you're stopped, unable to move, then finally you are freed by the urge to smoke.",2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""It will be like you're FLOATING along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.""

### Hypothesis:
""It will be like you're stopped, unable to move, then finally you are freed by the urge to smoke.""

### Analysis:
1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise describes a situation where someone is ""floating along fine,"" which implies a state of ease or normalcy.
   - Suddenly, this person is ""caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke,"" indicating a sudden and overwhelming desire to smoke.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis describes a situation where someone is ""stopped, unable to move,"" which implies a state of being stuck or immobilized.
   - Finally, this person is ""freed by the urge to smoke,"" suggesting that the urge to smoke releases them from their immobilized state.

### Comparison:
- The premise and hypothesis describe different initial states: ""floating along fine"" (ease) vs. ""stopped, unable to move"" (immobilized).
- The transition described in the premise is from ease to being overwhelmed by the urge to smoke.
- The transition described in the hypothesis is from being immobilized to being freed by the urge to smoke.

### Conclusion:
- The premise and hypothesis describe fundamentally different experiences and transitions.
- The hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise because the initial states and the nature of the transitions are contradictory.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

### Final Output:
2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"It will be like you're FLOATING along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.",In an instant you will be caught up in this huge urge to smoke after feeling like you're floating along fine.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""It will be like you're FLOATING along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.""
Hypothesis: ""In an instant you will be caught up in this huge urge to smoke after feeling like you're floating along fine.""

1. **Content Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a situation where a person feels like they are floating along fine and then suddenly experiences a strong urge to smoke.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases this situation, stating that in an instant, a person will be caught up in a huge urge to smoke after feeling like they are floating along fine.

2. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of events: feeling fine (floating along) followed by a sudden, strong urge to smoke.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise. It simply rephrases the Premise in a slightly different way.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise. If the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must also be true because it describes the same situation.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.,Laws change all the time throughout the years.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.
Hypothesis: Laws change all the time throughout the years.

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The Premise suggests that the law is expected to change frequently in the future (""jump back and forth"").
   - The use of ""probably"" indicates a high likelihood but not certainty.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The Hypothesis states that laws change frequently over time (""all the time throughout the years"").
   - This is a general statement about the nature of laws changing frequently.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The Premise talks about the future and suggests frequent changes in the law.
   - The Hypothesis makes a general statement about the nature of laws changing frequently over time.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The Premise implies a specific prediction about the future behavior of laws.
   - The Hypothesis makes a general statement that aligns with the idea of frequent changes but does not specify the future.
   - The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but the Premise does not definitively confirm the Hypothesis. The Premise suggests a likelihood, not a certainty, and the Hypothesis is a general statement.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as Neutral because the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.,The law will probably stay the same in the coming years.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.""
   - This suggests that the law is expected to change frequently and unpredictably in the future.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""The law will probably stay the same in the coming years.""
   - This suggests that the law is expected to remain stable and unchanged in the future.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates frequent changes in the law.
   - The Hypothesis indicates stability and no changes in the law.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis present opposite expectations about the future state of the law.
   - If the law is expected to change frequently (Premise), it cannot simultaneously be expected to stay the same (Hypothesis).

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final output:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.,In the coming years the law will most likely jump back and forth.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.
Hypothesis: In the coming years the law will most likely jump back and forth.

1. **Lexical Analysis**:
   - ""The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.""
   - ""In the coming years the law will most likely jump back and forth.""

2. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - Both sentences discuss the same subject: the law.
   - Both sentences predict the same action: the law jumping back and forth.
   - The time frame mentioned in both sentences is the same: in the coming years.
   - The words ""probably"" and ""most likely"" are synonymous, indicating a high probability but not certainty.

3. **Syntactic Analysis**:
   - The structure of both sentences is different, but the meaning conveyed is the same.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis restates the Premise using slightly different wording but retains the same meaning.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or adds uncertainty to the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is one of **Entailment**.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.,The 23 are scared the sub is sinking.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.""
   - This indicates that a group of 23 individuals is moving quickly and in a panicked manner to the back of a submarine.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The 23 are scared the sub is sinking.""
   - This suggests that the 23 individuals are frightened because they believe the submarine is sinking.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes frantic movement, which implies a sense of urgency or panic.
   - The Hypothesis provides a possible reason for this panic: fear that the submarine is sinking.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true, the Premise must explicitly or implicitly confirm that the reason for the frantic scrambling is the fear of the submarine sinking. The Premise does not provide this specific reason.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise indicates panic, which could be due to various reasons, including but not limited to the fear of sinking.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false, the Premise would need to indicate a different reason for the panic or explicitly state that the submarine is not sinking. The Premise does not provide such information.

Given that the Premise does not confirm or deny the specific reason for the panic, the relationship is best described as Neutral.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.,The 23 were calm at the rear of the sub.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.""
   - Key points: 
     - ""The 23"" refers to a group of 23 individuals.
     - ""frantically SCRAMBLED"" indicates a sense of urgency and panic.
     - ""to the rear of the sub"" specifies the location they moved to.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The 23 were calm at the rear of the sub.""
   - Key points:
     - ""The 23"" refers to the same group of 23 individuals.
     - ""were calm"" indicates a state of being relaxed and not panicked.
     - ""at the rear of the sub"" specifies the same location as in the premise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise describes the 23 individuals as ""frantically SCRAMBLED,"" which implies they were in a state of panic or urgency.
   - The hypothesis describes the same individuals as ""calm,"" which is the opposite of being frantic or panicked.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise because it states that the 23 individuals were calm, whereas the premise states they were frantic.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.,The rear of the sub had 23 frantically scrambling towards it.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.
Hypothesis: The rear of the sub had 23 frantically scrambling towards it.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that 23 individuals (or entities) were frantically moving towards the rear of the submarine.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that the rear of the submarine had 23 individuals (or entities) frantically moving towards it.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action: 23 individuals scrambling frantically.
   - The direction and location are consistent in both statements: towards the rear of the submarine.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with no additional information or contradictions.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,IRNA reported that Gomshadzehi killed a policeman and then ESCAPED to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates while trafficking drugs in 2003.,There is a criminal named Gomshadzehi who did not care about the lives of others or himself when he carried out his crimes in 2003.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""IRNA reported that Gomshadzehi killed a policeman and then ESCAPED to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates while trafficking drugs in 2003.""

### Hypothesis:
""There is a criminal named Gomshadzehi who did not care about the lives of others or himself when he carried out his crimes in 2003.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Key Information in the Premise:**
   - Gomshadzehi killed a policeman.
   - Gomshadzehi escaped to Dubai.
   - Gomshadzehi was trafficking drugs.
   - The events occurred in 2003.

2. **Identify Key Information in the Hypothesis:**
   - There is a criminal named Gomshadzehi.
   - He did not care about the lives of others or himself.
   - He carried out his crimes in 2003.

3. **Compare the Information:**
   - The Premise confirms that Gomshadzehi is a criminal.
   - The Premise indicates that Gomshadzehi killed a policeman, which suggests a disregard for the life of the policeman (others).
   - The Premise does not provide explicit information about whether Gomshadzehi cared about his own life, but escaping to Dubai could imply a concern for self-preservation.
   - The Premise confirms the crimes occurred in 2003.

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis makes a general statement about Gomshadzehi's disregard for the lives of others and himself, which is partially supported by the Premise (disregard for others is implied by the killing of the policeman).
   - The Premise does not provide explicit evidence about Gomshadzehi's disregard for his own life, making this part of the Hypothesis speculative.
   - The Hypothesis is not directly contradicted by the Premise, but it is not fully supported either.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise provides some support for the Hypothesis but does not fully confirm it.

### Relation:

     - Escaped to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates
     - Trafficking drugs in 2003

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - **Subject**: Gomshadzehi
   - **Actions**:
     - Helped a policeman
     - Was captive in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates
     - Trafficking drugs in 2003

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Action 1**: The Premise states that Gomshadzehi killed a policeman, while the Hypothesis states that Gomshadzehi helped a policeman. These actions are directly contradictory.
   - **Action 2**: The Premise states that Gomshadzehi escaped to Dubai, while the Hypothesis states that Gomshadzehi was captive in Dubai. These actions are also directly contradictory.
   - **Action 3**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that Gomshadzehi was trafficking drugs in 2003.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise because the actions described (helping vs. killing a policeman, being captive vs. escaping) are in direct contradiction.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2

intransitive-motion,schematic,Armed troops MARCHED to the substations and turned the power back on.,Armed troops MARCHED to the substations that powered over half of the city.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Armed troops MARCHED to the substations and turned the power back on.""
   - This statement tells us that armed troops went to the substations and restored power.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Armed troops MARCHED to the substations that powered over half of the city.""
   - This statement suggests that the substations the troops marched to were responsible for powering over half of the city.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not specify how much of the city the substations powered. It only mentions that the troops marched to the substations and turned the power back on.
   - The Hypothesis adds additional information about the substations powering over half of the city, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide information about the extent of the power coverage of the substations, we cannot definitively conclude that the substations powered over half of the city.
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information that is not present in the Premise, making it uncertain whether it is true or false based on the given Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Final answer:

   - This indicates that armed troops moved to the substations and restored the power.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Armed troops left the substations and turned the power off.""
   - This suggests that armed troops departed from the substations and cut off the power.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the troops went to the substations and turned the power on.
   - The Hypothesis states that the troops left the substations and turned the power off.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict the actions described in the Premise.
   - The Premise indicates the power was turned on, while the Hypothesis indicates the power was turned off.
   - The Premise indicates the troops went to the substations, while the Hypothesis indicates they left the substations.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

   - The reason for the arrest was Tran's involvement in a network smuggling heroin from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Vietnam News Agency, which has earned several prizes for journalism, said Australian national Tran Van Thanh was arrested on 30 June 2003 in the southern Vietnam city of Dalat.
   - The reason for the arrest was Tran's involvement in a network smuggling heroin.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis state that the Vietnam News Agency reported the arrest of Tran Van Thanh on 30 June 2003 in Dalat.
   - Both mention the reason for the arrest as involvement in a network smuggling heroin.
   - The Hypothesis adds an additional detail about the Vietnam News Agency having earned several prizes for journalism, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The additional detail about the Vietnam News Agency earning several prizes for journalism does not contradict the information in the Premise.
   - The core information about the arrest and the reason for it is consistent between the Premise and the Hypothesis.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as the additional detail about the prizes is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Vietnam News Agency reported that Tran Van Thanh, an Australian national, was arrested on 30 June 2003.
   - The arrest took place in the southern Vietnam city of Dalat.
   - The reason for the arrest was Tran's involvement in a network smuggling heroin from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Vietnam News Agency reported that Tran Van Thanh, an Australian national, was arrested on 30 June 2003.
   - The arrest took place in the southern Vietnam city of Dalat.
   - The reason for the arrest was Tran's involvement in a network hoarding and keeping heroin strictly in Cambodia.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree on the identity of the person (Tran Van Thanh), the date of the arrest (30 June 2003), and the location of the arrest (Dalat, southern Vietnam).
   - The key difference lies in the reason for the arrest:
     - **Premise**: Involvement in a network smuggling heroin from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam.
     - **Hypothesis**: Involvement in a network hoarding and keeping heroin strictly in Cambodia.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise states that Tran was involved in smuggling heroin across multiple countries (Cambodia, Vietnam, and Australia).
   - The Hypothesis states that Tran was involved in hoarding and keeping heroin strictly within Cambodia.
   - These two activities are mutually exclusive. If Tran was involved in smuggling heroin across countries, he could not have been involved in hoarding and keeping heroin strictly within Cambodia.

caused-motion,schematic,Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases but Indian officials suspect that poultry could be SMUGGLED through Myanmar from Thailand.,Poultry smuggling from Thailand is the main way that disease and crime spreads to Myanmar.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
- ""Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases but Indian officials suspect that poultry could be SMUGGLED through Myanmar from Thailand.""

### Hypothesis:
- ""Poultry smuggling from Thailand is the main way that disease and crime spreads to Myanmar.""

### Analysis:
1. **Content Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions that Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases and that Indian officials suspect poultry could be smuggled through Myanmar from Thailand.
   - The Hypothesis states that poultry smuggling from Thailand is the main way that disease and crime spread to Myanmar.

2. **Entailment Check**:
   - For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that poultry smuggling from Thailand is the main way disease and crime spread to Myanmar.
   - The Premise does not provide information about the main ways disease and crime spread to Myanmar. It only mentions a suspicion about poultry smuggling.

3. **Contradiction Check**:
   - For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that directly contradicts the Hypothesis.
   - The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis. It does not state that poultry smuggling is not a way disease and crime spread to Myanmar; it simply does not provide enough information to confirm or deny it.

4. **Neutral Check**:
   - For the Hypothesis to be neutral, the Premise must provide information that neither confirms nor denies the Hypothesis.
   - The Premise mentions a suspicion about poultry smuggling but does not provide enough information to conclude whether it is the main way disease and crime spread to Myanmar.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the Hypothesis. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is neutral.

Premise: Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases but Indian officials suspect that poultry could be SMUGGLED through Myanmar from Thailand.
Hypothesis: Myanmar has reported H5N1 cases but Indian officials suspect that poultry could be removed from Myanmar to Thailand.

1. **Comparison of H5N1 cases:**
   - Premise: ""Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases.""
   - Hypothesis: ""Myanmar has reported H5N1 cases.""
   - These statements are directly contradictory. The Premise states there are no reported cases, while the Hypothesis states there are reported cases.

2. **Comparison of poultry movement:**
   - Premise: ""Indian officials suspect that poultry could be SMUGGLED through Myanmar from Thailand.""
   - Hypothesis: ""Indian officials suspect that poultry could be removed from Myanmar to Thailand.""
   - The direction of the poultry movement is different. The Premise suggests poultry is smuggled from Thailand through Myanmar, while the Hypothesis suggests poultry is removed from Myanmar to Thailand. This also indicates a contradiction.

Given these points, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise because they directly contradict each other on both the H5N1 cases and the direction of poultry movement.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
caused-motion,schematic,Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases but Indian officials suspect that poultry could be SMUGGLED through Myanmar from Thailand.,Indian officials suspect that poultry could be smuggled through Myanmar from Thailand even though there's no reported H5N1 cases in Myanmar.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases.
   - Indian officials suspect that poultry could be smuggled through Myanmar from Thailand.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Indian officials suspect that poultry could be smuggled through Myanmar from Thailand.
   - This suspicion exists even though there are no reported H5N1 cases in Myanmar.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis restates the suspicion of Indian officials about poultry smuggling through Myanmar from Thailand.
   - The Hypothesis also acknowledges the fact that there are no reported H5N1 cases in Myanmar, which is consistent with the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with the same facts and suspicion.

Given that the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is one of **Entailment**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""After the seven hundred passengers on the train were stranded for two hours, they were GUIDED through the tunnels to a safe place.""
   - Key points: 
     - 700 passengers stranded for two hours.
     - They were guided through the tunnels.
     - They reached a safe place.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""After the seven hundred passengers on the train were stranded for two hours, they were led away from the tunnels to a safe place.""
   - Key points:
     - 700 passengers stranded for two hours.
     - They were led away from the tunnels.
     - They reached a safe place.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree on the number of passengers, the duration of being stranded, and that they reached a safe place.
   - The difference lies in the direction of movement:
     - Premise: ""guided through the tunnels.""
     - Hypothesis: ""led away from the tunnels.""

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise states that the passengers were guided through the tunnels, implying they moved within or through the tunnels.
   - The Hypothesis states that the passengers were led away from the tunnels, implying they moved out of or away from the tunnels.
   - These two statements are contradictory because moving through the tunnels and moving away from the tunnels are mutually exclusive actions.

### Premise:
""If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they KICK you out the door talk to a retiree.""

### Hypothesis:
""If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once you retire, then check out how many retirees live in Florida.""

### Analysis:
1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise suggests that once someone is ""kicked out the door"" (which implies being forced out or leaving under negative circumstances), the Headquarters Marine Corps does not care about them.
   - It advises talking to a retiree to understand this lack of care.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis suggests that if someone thinks the Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them once they retire, they should look at the number of retirees living in Florida.
   - This implies a different context (retirement) and introduces a new element (retirees living in Florida).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise focuses on being ""kicked out the door,"" which has a negative connotation and implies a lack of care.
   - The hypothesis focuses on retirement, which is a different situation and does not necessarily imply being ""kicked out.""
   - The hypothesis introduces a new idea (retirees living in Florida) that is not mentioned in the premise.

### Conclusion:
- The premise and hypothesis discuss different contexts (being kicked out vs. retiring).
- The hypothesis introduces new information not present in the premise.
- The hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise but also does not follow directly from it.

Given these points, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **Neutral**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that if someone thinks that Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out, they should talk to a retiree.
   - This implies that talking to a retiree will provide insight or confirmation that Headquarters Marine Corps does not care about them once they are kicked out.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that if someone thinks that Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out, they should not bother talking to a retiree.
   - This implies that talking to a retiree is unnecessary or unhelpful in confirming whether Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise suggests that talking to a retiree is a recommended action to understand the lack of care from Headquarters Marine Corps.
   - The hypothesis suggests the opposite, that talking to a retiree is not recommended or necessary.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. The premise recommends talking to a retiree, while the hypothesis advises against it.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the relation is:

Premise: If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they KICK you out the door talk to a retiree.
Hypothesis: Talk to a retiree if any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they kick you out the door.

1. **Content Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis contain the same information.
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise with the same meaning.

2. **Logical Structure**:
   - The Premise is a conditional statement suggesting that if someone thinks that the Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out, they should talk to a retiree.
   - The Hypothesis maintains the same conditional structure and meaning.

3. **Truth Evaluation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because it is essentially a restatement of the same idea.

Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
caused-motion,schematic,I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.,It is challenging for them to understand what is allowed to happen.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.""
Hypothesis: ""It is challenging for them to understand what is allowed to happen.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The speaker is expressing difficulty in understanding how a certain situation was permitted to occur.
   - The phrase ""I can't WRAP my head around"" is an idiomatic expression meaning the speaker finds it hard to comprehend.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis states that ""It is challenging for them to understand what is allowed to happen.""
   - This implies that ""they"" (which can be interpreted as the speaker or people in general) find it difficult to understand the permissions or allowances regarding a situation.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The premise and hypothesis both convey a sense of difficulty in understanding.
   - The premise uses a first-person perspective (""I can't wrap my head around""), while the hypothesis uses a third-person perspective (""It is challenging for them"").
   - Despite the difference in perspective, the core idea remains the same: there is a challenge in understanding how something was allowed to happen.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the premise.
   - The hypothesis is a generalization of the premise, maintaining the same meaning but in a broader context.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis can be considered definitely true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.""
   - This means the speaker is expressing confusion or inability to understand how a certain situation occurred.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""I can understand perfectly how this was allowed to happen.""
   - This means the speaker is expressing clear understanding of how the situation occurred.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states a lack of understanding (""I can't wrap my head around..."").
   - The Hypothesis states a clear understanding (""I can understand perfectly..."").

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis are expressing opposite states of understanding.
   - If the Premise is true (the speaker cannot understand), then the Hypothesis (the speaker can understand perfectly) cannot be true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

Premise: I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.
Hypothesis: How any of this was allowed to happen, I can't wrap my head around.

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The Premise expresses confusion or disbelief about how a certain situation was allowed to occur.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the same idea, maintaining the same meaning but with a different word order.

2. **Semantic Equivalence**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the exact same meaning. The Hypothesis is simply a rephrased version of the Premise.
   - There is no additional information or change in the context that would alter the meaning.

3. **Logical Relationship**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the same meaning, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

caused-motion,schematic,The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.,The MiG-25 is well-equipped compared to the Predator.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.""
   - This indicates that the MiG-25 launched an air-to-air missile (AAM) targeting the Predator.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The MiG-25 is well-equipped compared to the Predator.""
   - This suggests that the MiG-25 has superior equipment or capabilities relative to the Predator.

3. **Inference Evaluation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the act of firing an AAM must directly imply that the MiG-25 is well-equipped compared to the Predator. However, the Premise only mentions the action of firing a missile, not the overall equipment or capabilities of the MiG-25 compared to the Predator.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The fact that the MiG-25 fired an AAM at the Predator does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the MiG-25 is well-equipped compared to the Predator. There could be other factors or context that are not provided in the Premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. There is no information in the Premise that directly contradicts the Hypothesis. The action of firing an AAM does not negate the possibility that the MiG-25 is well-equipped compared to the Predator.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

caused-motion,schematic,The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.,The MiG-25 ceased fire at the Predator.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.""
   - This means that the MiG-25 launched an air-to-air missile (AAM) targeting the Predator.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The MiG-25 ceased fire at the Predator.""
   - This means that the MiG-25 stopped firing at the Predator.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates an active action of firing a missile.
   - The Hypothesis indicates the cessation of firing.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - If the MiG-25 is firing (as per the Premise), it cannot simultaneously be ceasing fire (as per the Hypothesis).
   - These two actions are mutually exclusive; if one is happening, the other cannot be true at the same time.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.""
   - This means that a MiG-25 aircraft launched an Air-to-Air Missile (AAM) targeting the Predator.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The Predator had an AAM fired at them by the MiG-25.""
   - This means that the Predator was the target of an Air-to-Air Missile (AAM) launched by the MiG-25.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: the MiG-25 firing an AAM at the Predator.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise, maintaining the same meaning and details.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they describe the same event), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.""
   - This indicates that Pope was transported by air to a specific U.S. military base located in Ramstein, Germany.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base in Germany, where he stayed for weeks.""
   - This indicates that Pope was transported by air to a U.S. military base in Germany and stayed there for weeks.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise confirms that Pope was flown to a specific U.S. military base in Germany (Ramstein).
   - The Hypothesis generalizes the location to any U.S. military base in Germany and adds the information that Pope stayed there for weeks.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it is possible that Pope stayed for weeks at the base after being flown there.
   - However, the Premise does not provide any information about the duration of Pope's stay, so we cannot definitively conclude that the Hypothesis is true based solely on the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1. **Premise**: ""Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.""
   - This statement asserts that the Pope was transported by air to a specific location, which is the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Pope didn't fly to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.""
   - This statement asserts that the Pope did not fly to the specified location.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the Pope was flown to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that the Pope did not fly to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly negates the information provided in the Premise, it cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

### Premise:
""Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali and jailed for 20 years.""

### Hypothesis:
""Schapelle Corby, who was Australian, got caught and was imprisoned for something illegal.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Key Information in the Premise:**
   - Schapelle Corby is Australian.
   - She was convicted of trafficking marijuana.
   - The trafficking occurred into Bali.
   - She was jailed for 20 years.

2. **Identify Key Information in the Hypothesis:**
   - Schapelle Corby is Australian.
   - She got caught.
   - She was imprisoned.
   - The reason for imprisonment was something illegal.

3. **Compare the Information:**
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis agree that Schapelle Corby is Australian.
   - The Hypothesis states she got caught, which aligns with being convicted in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis states she was imprisoned, which aligns with being jailed in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis mentions ""something illegal,"" which is a broader term but includes trafficking marijuana as specified in the Premise.

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict any information in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a generalization of the Premise, but it does not add any information that would make it uncertain or contradictory.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because trafficking marijuana is illegal, and being convicted and jailed implies she got caught and imprisoned.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

### Relation:

caused-motion,schematic,Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali and jailed for 20 years.,Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of removing marijuana from Bali and jailed for 20 years.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali and jailed for 20 years.
Hypothesis: Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of removing marijuana from Bali and jailed for 20 years.

1. **Identify Key Information in the Premise:**
   - Schapelle Corby was convicted.
   - The conviction was for trafficking marijuana.
   - The trafficking was into Bali.
   - She was jailed for 20 years.

2. **Identify Key Information in the Hypothesis:**
   - Schapelle Corby was convicted.
   - The conviction was for removing marijuana.
   - The removal was from Bali.
   - She was jailed for 20 years.

3. **Compare the Key Information:**
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis agree that Schapelle Corby was convicted and jailed for 20 years.
   - The key difference lies in the nature of the crime: 
     - Premise: Trafficking marijuana into Bali.
     - Hypothesis: Removing marijuana from Bali.

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The Premise states that the crime was trafficking marijuana into Bali, which means bringing marijuana into Bali.
   - The Hypothesis states that the crime was removing marijuana from Bali, which means taking marijuana out of Bali.
   - These two actions are opposite in nature: one involves bringing in, and the other involves taking out.

Since the actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are contradictory (one cannot be true if the other is true), the relationship is a contradiction.

caused-motion,schematic,Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali and jailed for 20 years.,Australian Schapelle Corby was jailed for 20 years because he was convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali and jailed for 20 years.""
   - Key points: 
     - Schapelle Corby is Australian.
     - Convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali.
     - Jailed for 20 years.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Australian Schapelle Corby was jailed for 20 years because he was convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali.""
   - Key points:
     - Schapelle Corby is Australian.
     - Jailed for 20 years.
     - The reason for the jail sentence is the conviction of trafficking marijuana into Bali.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that Schapelle Corby is Australian.
   - Both state that Schapelle Corby was convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali.
   - Both state that Schapelle Corby was jailed for 20 years.
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states that the reason for the 20-year jail sentence is the conviction of trafficking marijuana into Bali, which is implied in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because all the information in the Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
caused-motion,schematic,The Pakistan-born man was then DEPORTED to the United Kingdom on 070713.,The man from Pakistan went against his will to the United Kingdom for a crime committed.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The Pakistan-born man was then DEPORTED to the United Kingdom on 070713.""
   - Key points: 
     - The man is from Pakistan.
     - He was deported to the United Kingdom.
     - The deportation occurred on 070713 (July 7, 2013).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The man from Pakistan went against his will to the United Kingdom for a crime committed.""
   - Key points:
     - The man is from Pakistan.
     - He went to the United Kingdom against his will.
     - The reason for going to the United Kingdom was a crime committed.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that the man is from Pakistan and that he went to the United Kingdom.
   - The Premise states that the man was deported, which implies he went against his will.
   - The Hypothesis adds the detail that the reason for the deportation was a crime committed.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state the reason for the deportation.
   - The Hypothesis introduces the idea that the deportation was due to a crime, which is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
caused-motion,schematic,The Pakistan-born man was then DEPORTED to the United Kingdom on 070713.,The Pakistan-born man was then allowed to stay in the United Kingdom on 070713.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The Pakistan-born man was then DEPORTED to the United Kingdom on 070713.""
   - Key information: The man was deported to the United Kingdom on a specific date (070713).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The Pakistan-born man was then allowed to stay in the United Kingdom on 070713.""
   - Key information: The man was allowed to stay in the United Kingdom on the same date (070713).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the man was deported to the United Kingdom, which implies that he was sent out of a country to the United Kingdom.
   - The Hypothesis states that the man was allowed to stay in the United Kingdom, which implies that he was permitted to remain in the United Kingdom.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If the man was deported to the United Kingdom, it means he was sent there, not necessarily allowed to stay. Deportation typically implies being sent away from a country, often against one's will, and does not imply permission to stay.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise because being deported and being allowed to stay are mutually exclusive events.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final Relation Output: 2",Final Relation Output: 2,False,False,True,2
caused-motion,schematic,The Pakistan-born man was then DEPORTED to the United Kingdom on 070713.,On 070713 the Pakistan-born man was then deported to the United Kingdom.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The Pakistan-born man was then DEPORTED to the United Kingdom on 070713.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""On 070713 the Pakistan-born man was then deported to the United Kingdom.""

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:
- Both the Premise and the Hypothesis contain the same information: a Pakistan-born man was deported to the United Kingdom on the date 070713.
- The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is identical.
- There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that is not present in the Premise, and vice versa.
- The order of the information is rearranged, but this does not change the factual content.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and conveys the exact same information, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
caused-motion,schematic,The pilot refused to ALLOW the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.,The Pakistan-born man was a threat to the pilot on the pilot's plane.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The pilot refused to ALLOW the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.""
   - This statement tells us that the pilot did not permit the Pakistan-born man to board the plane. The reason for this refusal is not explicitly stated.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The Pakistan-born man was a threat to the pilot on the pilot's plane.""
   - This statement suggests that the Pakistan-born man posed a threat to the pilot, which is why he was not allowed on the plane.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide clear evidence that the Pakistan-born man was indeed a threat to the pilot. The Premise does not provide any information about the man being a threat; it only states that he was not allowed on the plane.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true or false based on the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the threat. The refusal could be due to various reasons unrelated to being a threat.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly contradicts the idea that the man was a threat. The Premise does not provide such information.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is **Neutral (1)** because the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the Hypothesis.

**Final Answer**:
1",1,False,True,False,1
caused-motion,schematic,The pilot refused to ALLOW the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.,The pilot insisted on allowing the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The pilot refused to ALLOW the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.""
   - This means the pilot did not permit the Pakistan-born man to board the plane.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The pilot insisted on allowing the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.""
   - This means the pilot was determined to permit the Pakistan-born man to board the plane.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the pilot did not allow the man onto the plane.
   - The Hypothesis states that the pilot was determined to allow the man onto the plane.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis present directly opposite actions regarding the pilot's decision.
   - If the pilot refused to allow the man, it is impossible for the pilot to insist on allowing the man at the same time.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship is a contradiction.

caused-motion,schematic,The pilot refused to ALLOW the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.,The Pakistan-born man was refused by the pilot to be allowed onto the pilot's plane.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The pilot refused to ALLOW the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.
Hypothesis: The Pakistan-born man was refused by the pilot to be allowed onto the pilot's plane.

1. **Check for Entailment (0):**
   - The Premise states that the pilot refused to allow the Pakistan-born man onto the plane.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases this by stating that the Pakistan-born man was refused by the pilot to be allowed onto the plane.
   - Both statements convey the same information: the pilot did not permit the Pakistan-born man to board the plane.

2. **Check for Neutral (1):**
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that is not present in the Premise. The Hypothesis does not introduce any new elements that could make it uncertain or ambiguous.

3. **Check for Contradiction (2):**
   - There is no contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis. Both statements are consistent with each other.

Since the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and conveys the same information, the correct relation is:

### Hypothesis:
""China confirmed on January 23, 2007 after 12 days of silence that China had FIRED a guided missile, JL-2 'Ju Lang' 2, into space.""

### Analysis:
1. **Common Information**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis state that China confirmed on January 23, 2007, after 12 days of silence, that China had fired a guided missile into space.
   
2. **Additional Information in Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis specifies the type of missile as ""JL-2 'Ju Lang' 2.""

3. **Consistency Check**:
   - The Premise does not specify the type of missile, only that a guided missile was fired.
   - The Hypothesis adds a specific detail (the type of missile) but does not contradict the Premise.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise because the Premise does not provide information about the specific type of missile. Therefore, the relationship is **Neutral**.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - **Event**: China returned a communications satellite from orbit back to Earth.
   - **Date**: May 14, 2007.
   - **Object**: A Chinese manufactured communications satellite.
   - **Beneficiary**: Nigeria.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The **Premise** states that the satellite was launched into orbit.
   - The **Hypothesis** states that the satellite was returned from orbit back to Earth.

4. **Inference**:
   - The action of launching a satellite into orbit (Premise) is fundamentally different from the action of returning a satellite from orbit back to Earth (Hypothesis).
   - These two actions cannot happen simultaneously for the same satellite on the same date. If a satellite is launched into orbit, it cannot be returned from orbit on the same day.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Kevin lifted the trumpet and filled the room with happy noise.""
   - This indicates that Kevin played the trumpet, and the sound produced was pleasant and filled the room.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Kevin lifted the trumpet and played to an audience that filled the room.""
   - This suggests that Kevin played the trumpet, and there was an audience present that filled the room.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that Kevin lifted the trumpet and played it.
   - The Premise mentions that the room was filled with happy noise, but it does not specify the presence of an audience.
   - The Hypothesis adds the detail that there was an audience filling the room, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information (the presence of an audience) that is not present in the Premise.
   - The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, but it also does not confirm the presence of an audience.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Kevin lifted the trumpet and filled the room with happy noise.""
   - This indicates that Kevin played the trumpet, resulting in a room filled with happy noise.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Kevin lowered the trumpet and filled the room with silence.""
   - This suggests that Kevin stopped playing the trumpet, resulting in a room filled with silence.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Kevin playing the trumpet filled the room with happy noise.
   - The Hypothesis states that Kevin stopping playing the trumpet filled the room with silence.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If Kevin is playing the trumpet and filling the room with happy noise, he cannot simultaneously be lowering the trumpet and filling the room with silence.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,Kevin lifted the trumpet and filled the room with happy noise.,Kevin lifted the trumpet and made happy noise in the room.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: Kevin lifted the trumpet and filled the room with happy noise.
Hypothesis: Kevin lifted the trumpet and made happy noise in the room.

1. **Compare the actions described:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis state that Kevin lifted the trumpet.
   - The Premise says Kevin ""filled the room with happy noise.""
   - The Hypothesis says Kevin ""made happy noise in the room.""

2. **Check for consistency:**
   - ""Filling the room with happy noise"" implies that the noise was pervasive and noticeable throughout the room.
   - ""Making happy noise in the room"" suggests that happy noise was produced in the room, but it does not specify the extent to which the noise filled the room.

3. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it is consistent with the idea that Kevin made happy noise in the room.
   - The Hypothesis is a less specific version of the Premise but does not introduce any new information that would make it false given the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis is a less detailed but consistent restatement of the Premise, it can be inferred that the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

causative-with-CxN,partial,Dude has filled the room with flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.,A man filled the room with sweet things for his significant other.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Dude has filled the room with flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.""
   - This statement describes a person (referred to as ""Dude"") who has filled a room with specific items: flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""A man filled the room with sweet things for his significant other.""
   - This statement describes a man who has filled a room with ""sweet things"" for his significant other.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions specific items: flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards.
   - The Hypothesis generalizes these items as ""sweet things"" and adds the purpose of doing it for his significant other.

4. **Inference Evaluation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise must explicitly or implicitly confirm all aspects of the Hypothesis.
     - The Premise does not explicitly mention that the items were for a significant other, nor does it use the term ""sweet things.""
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise provides some information that could support the Hypothesis, but it does not confirm it definitively.
     - The Premise describes actions that could be interpreted as sweet gestures, and it is plausible that these actions were for a significant other, but this is not explicitly stated.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise must provide information that directly contradicts the Hypothesis.
     - There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the idea that the items were for a significant other or that they are ""sweet things.""

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise**: ""Dude has filled the room with flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.""
   - This means that the room is currently full of flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Dude has emptied the room of flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.""
   - This means that the room currently has no flowers, teddy bears, or cheesy cards.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the room is filled with these items.
   - The Hypothesis states that the room is emptied of these items.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the room is filled with flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards (Premise), it cannot simultaneously be emptied of these items (Hypothesis).
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:

causative-with-CxN,partial,Dude has filled the room with flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.,Dude has moved flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards into the room.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: ""Dude has filled the room with flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.""
Hypothesis: ""Dude has moved flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards into the room.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The Premise states that the room is now filled with flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards. This implies that these items are present in the room in a significant quantity.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that the dude has moved flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards into the room. This implies an action of transferring these items into the room.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The action of ""filling the room"" with items inherently includes the action of ""moving"" those items into the room. For the room to be filled with these items, they must have been moved into the room at some point.
   - Therefore, if the room is filled with these items, it is necessarily true that these items were moved into the room.

4. **Determining the Relation**:
   - Since the action described in the Hypothesis (moving items into the room) is a necessary part of the state described in the Premise (room being filled with items), the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,An enormous chandelier filled the room with a stunning display of reflected light.,The room had a grand crystal chandelier displayed in its center.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""An enormous chandelier filled the room with a stunning display of reflected light.""
   - This sentence tells us that there is a large chandelier in the room, and it is creating a beautiful display of light.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The room had a grand crystal chandelier displayed in its center.""
   - This sentence suggests that there is a grand crystal chandelier in the center of the room.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions an ""enormous chandelier"" that is creating a stunning display of light. It does not specify the material of the chandelier, but it does imply that the chandelier is large and impressive.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that the chandelier is ""grand"" and ""crystal"" and is located in the center of the room.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state that the chandelier is made of crystal or that it is in the center of the room. However, it does describe the chandelier as enormous and creating a stunning display of light, which is consistent with the idea of a grand crystal chandelier.
   - The Hypothesis adds specific details (crystal and center location) that are not directly mentioned in the Premise but are plausible given the description of the chandelier in the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis is plausible but not definitively confirmed by the Premise, the relationship is best described as Neutral.

Therefore, the relation is:

   - The Premise describes the chandelier as ""enormous,"" while the Hypothesis describes it as ""small."" These descriptions are contradictory.
   - The Premise describes the display of reflected light as ""stunning,"" while the Hypothesis describes it as ""ordinary."" These descriptions are also contradictory.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true because the descriptions of the chandelier and the display of light are directly opposed.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final output:

   - If the Premise is true (an enormous chandelier filled the room with a stunning display of reflected light), then the Hypothesis must also be true (a stunning display of reflected light filled the room from the enormous chandelier).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,"Freshly ground coffee beans filled the room with a seductive, earthy aroma.",Aromatic coffee beans were ground for a fresh cup of coffee.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: Freshly ground coffee beans filled the room with a seductive, earthy aroma.
Hypothesis: Aromatic coffee beans were ground for a fresh cup of coffee.

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - Freshly ground coffee beans
   - Filled the room with a seductive, earthy aroma

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - Aromatic coffee beans
   - Were ground for a fresh cup of coffee

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention coffee beans that have been ground.
   - The Premise emphasizes the aroma filling the room, while the Hypothesis suggests the purpose of grinding the beans is for a fresh cup of coffee.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Premise does not explicitly state that the coffee beans were ground for a fresh cup of coffee, but it is a reasonable assumption given the context.
   - The Hypothesis is plausible and consistent with the Premise, but it introduces an additional detail (the purpose of grinding the beans) that is not explicitly mentioned in the Premise.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the purpose of grinding the beans.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,"Freshly ground coffee beans filled the room with a seductive, earthy aroma.","Stale whole coffee beans filled the room with an unattractive, otherworldly scent.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Freshly ground coffee beans filled the room with a seductive, earthy aroma.""
   - This statement describes a scenario where freshly ground coffee beans are present, and they produce a pleasant, earthy smell.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Stale whole coffee beans filled the room with an unattractive, otherworldly scent.""
   - This statement describes a different scenario where stale whole coffee beans are present, and they produce an unpleasant, otherworldly smell.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about ""freshly ground coffee beans"" and their ""seductive, earthy aroma.""
   - The Hypothesis talks about ""stale whole coffee beans"" and their ""unattractive, otherworldly scent.""
   - The two statements describe different types of coffee beans (freshly ground vs. stale whole) and different types of aromas (seductive, earthy vs. unattractive, otherworldly).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise because the descriptions of the coffee beans and their aromas are completely different and contradictory.
   - The Premise suggests a positive, pleasant aroma from freshly ground beans, while the Hypothesis suggests a negative, unpleasant scent from stale whole beans.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,"Freshly ground coffee beans filled the room with a seductive, earthy aroma.","The room was filled with a seductive, earthly aroma from freshly ground coffee beans.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: Freshly ground coffee beans filled the room with a seductive, earthy aroma.
2. **Hypothesis**: The room was filled with a seductive, earthly aroma from freshly ground coffee beans.

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:
- Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: freshly ground coffee beans filling the room with a seductive, earthy (or earthly) aroma.
- The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.
- The key elements (""freshly ground coffee beans,"" ""filled the room,"" ""seductive,"" ""earthy/earthly aroma"") are consistent between the Premise and the Hypothesis.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and does not add or contradict any information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,The Grateful Dead have flooded the market with excellent live material.,The Grateful Dead have put out live recordings of their best concert that took place at a market flooded with fans.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The Grateful Dead have flooded the market with excellent live material.""
   - This means that the band, The Grateful Dead, has released a large amount of high-quality live recordings.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The Grateful Dead have put out live recordings of their best concert that took place at a market flooded with fans.""
   - This suggests that The Grateful Dead released recordings of a specific concert, which was their best, and that this concert took place at a market crowded with fans.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about the general release of excellent live material by The Grateful Dead.
   - The Hypothesis specifies a particular concert and its recording, adding details about the concert being the best and taking place at a market crowded with fans.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about a specific concert or the conditions of the concert (e.g., being the best or taking place at a market with fans).
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis introduces new information that is not necessarily implied by the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. There is no direct contradiction, but the Premise does not entail the specific details of the Hypothesis either.

Thus, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,The Grateful Dead have flooded the market with excellent live material.,The Grateful Dead have not released any good live material on the market.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that there is a large quantity of excellent live material released by The Grateful Dead.
   - The Hypothesis states that there is no good live material released by The Grateful Dead.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the Premise is true (that there is a large amount of excellent live material), then the Hypothesis (that there is no good live material) cannot be true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,The Grateful Dead have flooded the market with excellent live material.,Excellent live material has flooded the market from The Grateful Dead.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

   - This statement suggests that the advertisements Samsung has used are specifically described as ""tasteful"" and ""funny.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Samsung has done a lot of advertising, but it does not specify the nature or quality of the ads.
   - The Hypothesis adds additional information about the nature of the ads, describing them as ""tasteful"" and ""funny.""

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the ads are ""tasteful"" and ""funny."" The Premise does not provide this specific information.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the specific qualities of the ads. Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly opposes the idea that the ads are ""tasteful"" and ""funny."" The Premise does not do this.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.,Samsung has held back with their advertising.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.""
   - This means that Samsung has extensively and aggressively advertised their products, implying a high volume and frequency of advertisements.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Samsung has held back with their advertising.""
   - This means that Samsung has been restrained or conservative with their advertising efforts, implying a low volume and frequency of advertisements.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Samsung has done a lot of advertising.
   - The Hypothesis states that Samsung has done very little advertising.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The two statements are directly contradictory. If Samsung has flooded the market with advertising, it cannot simultaneously be true that they have held back with their advertising.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.,The market is flooded with Samsung's advertising.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.""
Hypothesis: ""The market is flooded with Samsung's advertising.""

1. **Check for Entailment (0)**:
   - The Premise states that Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.
   - The Hypothesis states that the market is flooded with Samsung's advertising.
   - Both statements convey the same information: the market is saturated with Samsung's advertising efforts.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that is not already present in the Premise.

2. **Check for Neutral (1)**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or context that might make it uncertain or ambiguous given the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is not adding any new elements that are not directly supported by the Premise.

3. **Check for Contradiction (2)**:
   - There is no conflicting information between the Premise and the Hypothesis.
   - The Hypothesis does not negate or contradict the Premise in any way.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. Therefore, the relation is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.,Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil that was sold to at least five countries.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.""
   - This statement indicates that Saudi Arabia increased the supply of cheap oil in the market with the intention of recovering their market share.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil that was sold to at least five countries.""
   - This statement suggests that the cheap oil Saudi Arabia flooded the market with was sold to at least five countries.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not specify the number of countries to which the cheap oil was sold. It only mentions that Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap oil to recover their market share.
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information that the cheap oil was sold to at least five countries, which is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide any information about the number of countries the oil was sold to, we cannot definitively conclude that the Hypothesis is true or false based on the Premise alone.
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the specific detail about the number of countries.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Final answer:

causative-with-CxN,partial,Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.,Saudi reduced the market's supply of cheap oil so they could deteriorate their market share.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.""
Hypothesis: ""Saudi reduced the market's supply of cheap oil so they could deteriorate their market share.""

1. **Identify the key actions and intentions in the Premise:**
   - Action: ""flooded the market with cheap oil""
   - Intention: ""so they could recover their market share""

2. **Identify the key actions and intentions in the Hypothesis:**
   - Action: ""reduced the market's supply of cheap oil""
   - Intention: ""so they could deteriorate their market share""

3. **Compare the actions:**
   - The Premise states that Saudi ""flooded the market with cheap oil,"" which means they increased the supply of cheap oil.
   - The Hypothesis states that Saudi ""reduced the market's supply of cheap oil,"" which means they decreased the supply of cheap oil.

   These actions are directly opposite to each other.

4. **Compare the intentions:**
   - The Premise states the intention was to ""recover their market share.""
   - The Hypothesis states the intention was to ""deteriorate their market share.""

   These intentions are also directly opposite to each other.

5. **Determine the relationship:**
   - Since the actions and intentions in the Hypothesis are directly opposite to those in the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

causative-with-CxN,partial,Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.,"To recover their market share, Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.""
Hypothesis: ""To recover their market share, Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil.""

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis discuss the same event: Saudi Arabia flooding the market with cheap oil.
   - Both statements indicate the same purpose for this action: to recover their market share.

2. **Order and Causality**:
   - The Premise states the action first (""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil"") and then provides the reason (""so they could recover their market share"").
   - The Hypothesis states the reason first (""To recover their market share"") and then the action (""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil"").

3. **Logical Equivalence**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. The order of the clauses is reversed, but the meaning remains the same.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise with the same meaning, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.,"The Chinese have the largest, juiciest apples on the market.",1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.""
   - This statement indicates that the Chinese have introduced a large quantity of apples suitable for making juice into the market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The Chinese have the largest, juiciest apples on the market.""
   - This statement suggests that the Chinese apples are the largest and juiciest available in the market.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about the quantity and type (juice-grade) of apples the Chinese have introduced to the market.
   - The Hypothesis makes a qualitative claim about the size and juiciness of the apples.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise would need to explicitly state that the Chinese apples are the largest and juiciest. The Premise does not provide this information.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the size and juiciness of the apples. It only mentions the quantity and type (juice-grade), which does not directly relate to the largest and juiciest claim.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: There is no information in the Premise that directly contradicts the Hypothesis. The Premise does not state that the Chinese apples are not the largest and juiciest.

Given the analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.,The Chinese already have under produced in the market with juice-grade apples.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.
Hypothesis: The Chinese already have under produced in the market with juice-grade apples.

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The phrase ""flooded the market"" implies that there is an abundance or oversupply of juice-grade apples in the market due to the Chinese.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The phrase ""under produced"" implies that there is a shortage or insufficient supply of juice-grade apples in the market due to the Chinese.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise states that there is an oversupply of juice-grade apples.
   - The Hypothesis states that there is an undersupply of juice-grade apples.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis present directly opposing situations: one indicates an oversupply, while the other indicates an undersupply.
   - These two statements cannot both be true at the same time.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the relation is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.,Juice-grade apples have already been flooded in the market by the Chinese.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.
Hypothesis: Juice-grade apples have already been flooded in the market by the Chinese.

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention ""juice-grade apples"" and ""the Chinese.""
   - Both statements indicate that the market has been ""flooded"" with these apples.
   - The temporal aspect ""already"" is present in both statements.

2. **Paraphrasing Check**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. The structure is different, but the meaning is the same.
   - The Premise states that ""The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.""
   - The Hypothesis states that ""Juice-grade apples have already been flooded in the market by the Chinese.""

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.
   - There is no missing information in the Hypothesis that would make it less certain than the Premise.

causative-with-CxN,partial,Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.,He turned his face to the wall and covered it out of embarrassment.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.""
   - This sentence describes an action where someone turns to face the wall and then covers their face with a pillow.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He turned his face to the wall and covered it out of embarrassment.""
   - This sentence describes a similar action but adds a reason for the action, specifically stating that it was done out of embarrassment.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the reason for the action. It only describes the physical actions of turning to the wall and covering the face with a pillow.
   - The Hypothesis introduces an additional element (embarrassment) that is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude the Hypothesis. Since the Premise does not mention embarrassment, we cannot definitively conclude the Hypothesis from the Premise.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide information about the reason for the action, so it is possible that the action was done out of embarrassment, but it is also possible that it was done for another reason.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that directly conflicts with the Hypothesis. Since the Premise does not provide any reason for the action, there is no direct conflict with the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.,Turning away fromt he wall he uncovered his face with a pillow.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.
Hypothesis: Turning away from the wall he uncovered his face with a pillow.

1. **Identify the main actions in the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Premise: ""Turning to the wall"" and ""covered his face with a pillow.""
   - Hypothesis: ""Turning away from the wall"" and ""uncovered his face with a pillow.""

2. **Compare the actions and directions:**
   - The Premise states that he turned to the wall and covered his face with a pillow.
   - The Hypothesis states that he turned away from the wall and uncovered his face with a pillow.

3. **Check for consistency or contradiction:**
   - The actions in the Hypothesis are the opposite of those in the Premise. In the Premise, he is turning towards the wall and covering his face, while in the Hypothesis, he is turning away from the wall and uncovering his face.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - Since the actions and directions in the Hypothesis directly contradict those in the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.,He covered his face with a pillow as he turned toward the wall.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.
Hypothesis: He covered his face with a pillow as he turned toward the wall.

1. **Identify the main actions and their sequence in the Premise:**
   - Action 1: Turning to the wall.
   - Action 2: He covered his face with a pillow.

2. **Identify the main actions and their sequence in the Hypothesis:**
   - Action 1: He covered his face with a pillow.
   - Action 2: As he turned toward the wall.

3. **Compare the sequences and actions:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same two actions: turning to the wall and covering his face with a pillow.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that these actions happen simultaneously or in a closely related manner (""as he turned toward the wall"").

4. **Determine if the Hypothesis is definitely true, possibly true, or definitely false given the Premise:**
   - The Premise states that he turned to the wall and covered his face with a pillow. The Hypothesis rephrases this to imply that the actions are happening at the same time.
   - There is no contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis. The Hypothesis is a plausible rephrasing of the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The school filled his head with knowledge"" implies that the school provided him with information and learning.
   - ""challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework"" suggests that the school presented him with academic challenges to assess and reinforce his learning.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The school emptied his head of knowledge"" implies that the school took away or reduced his knowledge, which is the opposite of filling his head with knowledge.
   - ""easing him with tests, quizzes, and homework"" suggests that the school made things easier for him with these academic activities, which is the opposite of challenging him.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the school filled his head with knowledge and challenged him.
   - The Hypothesis states that the school emptied his head of knowledge and eased him.

causative-with-CxN,partial,"Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.","Susan was a trapper by trade, specializing in mink hats.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.""
   - This sentence suggests that Susan deceived someone and manipulated them with false information.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Susan was a trapper by trade, specializing in mink hats.""
   - This sentence suggests that Susan's profession involves trapping animals, specifically for making mink hats.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about Susan's actions of deception and manipulation.
   - The Hypothesis talks about Susan's profession as a trapper of animals for mink hats.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - There is no direct connection between Susan's deceptive actions in the Premise and her profession in the Hypothesis.
   - The Premise does not provide any information about Susan's profession, so we cannot confirm or deny the Hypothesis based on the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. There is no definitive evidence to support or contradict the Hypothesis based on the information provided in the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,"Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.","Susan let him free, cleared his head of lies.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.""
   - This indicates that Susan has confined someone and deceived them by telling lies.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Susan let him free, cleared his head of lies.""
   - This suggests that Susan has released the person and removed the lies from their mind.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Susan trapped and deceived the person.
   - The Hypothesis states that Susan did the opposite: she freed the person and removed the lies.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict the actions described in the Premise.
   - If Susan trapped and deceived the person (Premise), she cannot simultaneously have freed and cleared the person's head of lies (Hypothesis).

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,"Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.","Susan filled his head with lies, trapped him.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.
2. **Hypothesis**: Susan filled his head with lies, trapped him.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Content Comparison**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis contain the same actions: ""trapped him"" and ""filled his head with lies.""
- **Order of Actions**: The order of the actions is different in the Premise and the Hypothesis. However, the order does not change the meaning of the actions themselves.
- **Meaning**: The meaning conveyed by both the Premise and the Hypothesis is identical. Both statements assert that Susan did two things: trapped him and filled his head with lies.

### Conclusion:

Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (the actions and their implications are the same despite the order), the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,"They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.",They made him take pills that were supposed to ease his headache.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.""
   - This suggests that the pills had an adverse effect, causing an unpleasant sensation described as ""cold, silent noise"" in his head.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""They made him take pills that were supposed to ease his headache.""
   - This suggests that the intended purpose of the pills was to alleviate a headache.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes the actual effect of the pills, which is negative (""cold, silent noise"").
   - The Hypothesis describes the intended purpose of the pills, which is positive (to ease a headache).

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis are discussing different aspects of the same situation: the Premise talks about the actual effect, while the Hypothesis talks about the intended effect.
   - The actual effect described in the Premise contradicts the intended effect described in the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction** because the pills did not ease his headache; instead, they caused an unpleasant sensation.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,"They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.","They made him give away pills that emptied his head of cold, silent noise.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.""
   - This means that someone forced him to consume pills, and as a result, his head was filled with ""cold, silent noise.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""They made him give away pills that emptied his head of cold, silent noise.""
   - This means that someone forced him to distribute pills, and as a result, his head was emptied of ""cold, silent noise.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that taking pills filled his head with cold, silent noise.
   - The Hypothesis states that giving away pills emptied his head of cold, silent noise.
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are different: taking pills vs. giving away pills.
   - The effects described in the Premise and Hypothesis are opposite: filling his head vs. emptying his head.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis describes a scenario that is not only different from the Premise but also directly contradicts it in terms of the action taken and its effect.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,"They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.","His head was filled with cold, silent noise from pills they made him take.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.
Hypothesis: His head was filled with cold, silent noise from pills they made him take.

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""They made him take pills"" and these pills ""filled his head with cold, silent noise.""
   - The Hypothesis states that ""His head was filled with cold, silent noise"" and attributes this to ""pills they made him take.""

2. **Information Matching**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the same cause (pills they made him take) and the same effect (his head being filled with cold, silent noise).
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with no additional information or contradictions.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.,"There are other teachers, but one was trying to conceal her body with a sheet.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.""
   - This statement indicates that there is at least one teacher who took action to cover someone's body with a black sheet.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""There are other teachers, but one was trying to conceal her body with a sheet.""
   - This statement suggests that there are multiple teachers, and one specific teacher was attempting to conceal someone's body with a sheet.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions ""one of the teachers,"" which implies the existence of more than one teacher.
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states ""there are other teachers,"" which aligns with the implication in the Premise.
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that one teacher was involved in covering or concealing a body with a sheet.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is consistent with the information provided in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.,One of the teachers left after removing a black sheet from her body.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.
Hypothesis: One of the teachers left after removing a black sheet from her body.

1. **Identify the key actions and subjects in the Premise:**
   - Subject: One of the teachers
   - Action: Came along and covered her body with a black sheet

2. **Identify the key actions and subjects in the Hypothesis:**
   - Subject: One of the teachers
   - Action: Left after removing a black sheet from her body

3. **Compare the actions and subjects:**
   - The Premise describes a teacher covering her body with a black sheet.
   - The Hypothesis describes a teacher leaving after removing a black sheet from her body.

4. **Determine the logical relationship:**
   - The actions in the Hypothesis (leaving after removing a black sheet) are not directly supported by the actions in the Premise (covering her body with a black sheet).
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the teacher removing the black sheet or leaving.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis introduces new information that is not entailed by the Premise.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the actions described in the Hypothesis.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.,One of the teachers covered her body with a black sheet after she came along.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.
Hypothesis: One of the teachers covered her body with a black sheet after she came along.

1. **Identify the main events in the Premise:**
   - A teacher came along.
   - The same teacher covered her body with a black sheet.

2. **Identify the main events in the Hypothesis:**
   - A teacher covered her body with a black sheet.
   - This action happened after she came along.

3. **Compare the sequence and content of events:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same two events: a teacher coming along and then covering her body with a black sheet.
   - The sequence of events is the same in both the Premise and the Hypothesis: the teacher comes along first, and then she covers her body with a black sheet.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise with the same sequence of events.

Given that the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the information provided in the Premise, the relationship is:

0 – Entailment

Therefore, the relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,Howze filled her house with music and color.,Howze was the best roommate she had ever had.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""Howze filled her house with music and color.""
   - This statement tells us that Howze contributed to the house by adding music and color. It implies that Howze had a positive impact on the house's atmosphere.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""Howze was the best roommate she had ever had.""
   - This statement makes a subjective claim about Howze being the best roommate. It is an evaluative statement based on personal judgment.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides specific actions (filling the house with music and color) but does not provide any direct information about Howze being the best roommate.
   - The Hypothesis is a subjective evaluation that could be influenced by many factors beyond just filling the house with music and color.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise would need to explicitly state or strongly imply that Howze was the best roommate. The Premise does not provide this level of information.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise provides positive information about Howze, which could contribute to her being considered the best roommate, but it does not definitively establish this.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise only if the Premise provided information that directly contradicts the Hypothesis. There is no such contradiction here.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,Howze filled her house with music and color.,Howze emptied her house of music and color.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Howze filled her house with music and color.""
   - This statement indicates that Howze added music and color to her house.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Howze emptied her house of music and color.""
   - This statement indicates that Howze removed music and color from her house.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that music and color were added to the house.
   - The Hypothesis states that music and color were removed from the house.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If Howze filled her house with music and color, it cannot be true that she emptied her house of music and color at the same time.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Howze filled her house with music and color.,The house was filled with music and color by Howze.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: Howze filled her house with music and color.
2. **Hypothesis**: The house was filled with music and color by Howze.

- **Step 1: Check for Entailment (0)**
  - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise using a passive construction but retains the same meaning.
  - Both statements indicate that Howze is the agent who filled the house with music and color.
  - There is no additional information or change in meaning between the Premise and the Hypothesis.

- **Step 2: Check for Contradiction (2)**
  - There is no information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.
  - Both statements are consistent with each other.

- **Step 3: Check for Neutral (1)**
  - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that is not present in the Premise.
  - The Hypothesis does not leave room for uncertainty or additional possibilities beyond what is stated in the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise with the same meaning, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.,The red wine bottle was opened by him and he poured her a glass full of it.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The cork came out with a pleasant pop"" suggests that a bottle was opened.
   - ""He filled her glass with the rich red liquid"" indicates that a liquid, specifically red in color, was poured into a glass.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The red wine bottle was opened by him"" suggests that a bottle of red wine was opened.
   - ""He poured her a glass full of it"" indicates that the liquid from the bottle was poured into a glass.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes the action of opening a bottle and pouring a red liquid into a glass.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that the bottle was a red wine bottle and that the liquid poured was red wine.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state that the bottle was a red wine bottle, but it does mention a ""rich red liquid,"" which is commonly associated with red wine.
   - The action of opening the bottle and pouring the liquid matches between the Premise and the Hypothesis.

Given that the Hypothesis is a reasonable and specific interpretation of the Premise, and there is no information in the Premise that contradicts the Hypothesis, the Hypothesis can be considered definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.,The cork came out with a horrible pop and he emptied her glass of the rich red liquid.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The cork came out with a pleasant pop"" indicates a positive experience with the cork coming out.
   - ""He filled her glass with the rich red liquid"" suggests that the glass was empty before and is now filled with a red liquid, likely wine.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The cork came out with a horrible pop"" indicates a negative experience with the cork coming out, which directly contradicts the ""pleasant pop"" in the premise.
   - ""He emptied her glass of the rich red liquid"" suggests that the glass was initially full and is now empty, which directly contradicts the action of filling the glass in the premise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The description of the cork coming out (pleasant vs. horrible) is directly contradictory.
   - The action regarding the glass (filling vs. emptying) is also directly contradictory.

Given these direct contradictions in both parts of the statements, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.,He filled her glass with the rich red liquid that came from opening the cork with a pleasant pop.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.""
   - This sentence describes two actions: the cork coming out with a pleasant pop and the act of filling her glass with a rich red liquid.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He filled her glass with the rich red liquid that came from opening the cork with a pleasant pop.""
   - This sentence describes the act of filling her glass with a rich red liquid, specifying that the liquid came from opening the cork with a pleasant pop.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of events: the cork coming out with a pleasant pop and the glass being filled with a rich red liquid.
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states that the rich red liquid came from the cork that popped, which is implied in the Premise.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise with the same meaning.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,The waiter filled her glass with white wine.,She ordered the white wine in a glass.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The waiter filled her glass with white wine.""
   - This statement indicates that a waiter poured white wine into a glass that belongs to a female individual.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She ordered the white wine in a glass.""
   - This statement suggests that the female individual requested white wine to be served in a glass.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about whether the female individual ordered the white wine. It only states that the waiter filled her glass with white wine.
   - The Hypothesis introduces the idea that she ordered the white wine, which is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not confirm or deny whether she ordered the white wine, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the given information.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Final output:
1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,The waiter filled her glass with white wine.,The waiter emptied her glass of white wine.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The waiter filled her glass with white wine.
Hypothesis: The waiter emptied her glass of white wine.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The action described is that the waiter added white wine to her glass, resulting in the glass being filled with white wine.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The action described is that the waiter removed white wine from her glass, resulting in the glass being emptied of white wine.

3. **Comparing the Actions**:
   - The action in the Premise (filling the glass) is the opposite of the action in the Hypothesis (emptying the glass).
   - If the glass is filled with white wine, it cannot simultaneously be emptied of white wine.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - Since the actions are directly contradictory (filling vs. emptying), the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,The waiter filled her glass with white wine.,Her glass was filled with white wine by the waiter.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The waiter filled her glass with white wine.
Hypothesis: Her glass was filled with white wine by the waiter.

1. **Check for Entailment (0)**:
   - The Premise states that ""The waiter filled her glass with white wine.""
   - The Hypothesis states that ""Her glass was filled with white wine by the waiter.""
   - Both sentences convey the same information, just phrased differently. The action and the participants are the same, and the meaning is preserved.

2. **Check for Neutral (1)**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that is not present in the Premise.
   - There is no ambiguity or additional context needed to determine the truth of the Hypothesis based on the Premise.

3. **Check for Contradiction (2)**:
   - There is no information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.
   - Both statements are consistent with each other.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the same information, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.,"After filling her pockets with rocks, Virginia Woolf walked into a river famous for its clear waters.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.""
   - This statement provides two key pieces of information:
     - Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks.
     - Virginia Woolf walked into a river.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""After filling her pockets with rocks, Virginia Woolf walked into a river famous for its clear waters.""
   - This statement provides additional information:
     - Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks (consistent with the Premise).
     - Virginia Woolf walked into a river (consistent with the Premise).
     - The river is described as ""famous for its clear waters"" (new information not mentioned in the Premise).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis repeats the actions described in the Premise (filling pockets with rocks and walking into a river).
   - The Hypothesis adds a new detail about the river being ""famous for its clear waters,"" which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The new detail about the river's clear waters does not contradict the Premise.
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the clarity of the river's waters, so the Hypothesis could be true or false based on the Premise alone.

Given that the Hypothesis introduces new information that is not addressed in the Premise but does not contradict it, the relationship is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.,Virginia Woolf emptied her pockets of rocks and walked away from the river.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.""
Hypothesis: ""Virginia Woolf emptied her pockets of rocks and walked away from the river.""

1. **Identify the key actions and states in the Premise:**
   - Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks.
   - Virginia Woolf walked into a river.

2. **Identify the key actions and states in the Hypothesis:**
   - Virginia Woolf emptied her pockets of rocks.
   - Virginia Woolf walked away from the river.

3. **Compare the actions and states:**
   - The Premise states that Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks, while the Hypothesis states that she emptied her pockets of rocks. These actions are directly opposite.
   - The Premise states that Virginia Woolf walked into a river, while the Hypothesis states that she walked away from the river. These actions are also directly opposite.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict the actions described in the Premise. If Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river, it is not possible for her to have emptied her pockets of rocks and walked away from the river at the same time.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.,Virginia Woolf walked into a river after filling her pockets with rocks.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.
Hypothesis: Virginia Woolf walked into a river after filling her pockets with rocks.

1. **Identify the actions in the Premise:**
   - Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks.
   - Virginia Woolf walked into a river.

2. **Identify the actions in the Hypothesis:**
   - Virginia Woolf walked into a river.
   - Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks (before walking into the river).

3. **Compare the sequence of actions:**
   - The Premise states that Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and then walked into a river.
   - The Hypothesis states that Virginia Woolf walked into a river after filling her pockets with rocks.

4. **Check for consistency:**
   - The sequence of actions in the Hypothesis matches the sequence of actions in the Premise.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis.

Since the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and maintains the same sequence of events, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.,Blizzards can be fun for children playing in the snow.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.""
   - This sentence describes a situation where a blizzard is actively covering people with snow. It implies a severe weather condition with heavy snowfall.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Blizzards can be fun for children playing in the snow.""
   - This sentence makes a general statement about blizzards potentially being enjoyable for children who are playing in the snow.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a specific event where a blizzard is covering people with snow, suggesting a potentially dangerous or severe situation.
   - The Hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a general statement about the potential enjoyment of blizzards for children.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise directly supported the idea that blizzards are fun for children. However, the Premise does not provide any information about children or fun.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the general statement about children having fun in blizzards.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise directly contradicted the idea that blizzards can be fun for children. The Premise does not explicitly contradict the Hypothesis; it simply describes a severe weather event.

Given the analysis, the Premise does not provide enough information to determine whether the Hypothesis is true or false. Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.,A blizzard soon took snow away from their bodies.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.""
   - This means that a blizzard caused snow to accumulate on their bodies.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""A blizzard soon took snow away from their bodies.""
   - This means that a blizzard caused snow to be removed from their bodies.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the blizzard caused snow to cover their bodies.
   - The Hypothesis states that the blizzard caused snow to be removed from their bodies.
   - These two statements are directly opposite in meaning.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise, it cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.,Their bodies were soon covered with snow from the blizzard.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

   - This statement indicates that a blizzard occurred and as a result, snow covered their bodies.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Their bodies were soon covered with snow from the blizzard.""
   - This statement indicates that their bodies were covered with snow, and the source of the snow is the blizzard.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: a blizzard causing snow to cover their bodies.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise without adding or contradicting any information.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

comparative-correlative,partial,"The harder they come, the harder they fall.",They are likely to be injured if they fall hard.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The harder they come, the harder they fall.""
   - This is a proverb suggesting that the more forceful or intense someone or something is, the more significant their downfall will be.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""They are likely to be injured if they fall hard.""
   - This statement suggests that a hard fall increases the likelihood of injury.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about the intensity of the fall being proportional to the intensity of the rise or approach.
   - The Hypothesis talks about the consequences (injury) of a hard fall.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly mention injury or the consequences of falling hard, only the intensity of the fall.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new element (injury) that is not directly addressed in the Premise.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude the likelihood of injury from a hard fall.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Final Relation Output: 1",Final Relation Output: 1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The harder they come, the harder they fall.",How hard they fall is dependent on their actions.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The harder they come, the harder they fall.""
- This statement suggests a direct relationship between the intensity or difficulty of a situation and the severity of the consequences. It implies that the more challenging or intense the situation, the more significant the impact or downfall.

Hypothesis: ""How hard they fall is dependent on their actions.""
- This statement suggests that the severity of the consequences (how hard they fall) is influenced by their actions.

Now, let's compare the two statements:

1. **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, it must be definitely true given the Premise. The Premise talks about the relationship between the intensity of a situation and the severity of the consequences, but it does not explicitly mention that this relationship is dependent on actions. Therefore, the Hypothesis is not definitely true based on the Premise alone.

2. **Neutral (1)**: For the Hypothesis to be neutral, it may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny that the severity of the consequences is dependent on actions. It only states a general relationship between the intensity of a situation and the severity of the consequences. Therefore, the Hypothesis could be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the Premise alone.

3. **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, it must be impossible given the Premise. The Premise does not contradict the idea that the severity of the consequences could be dependent on actions. Therefore, the Hypothesis is not impossible given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The harder they come, the harder they fall.",They will fall softly regardless of how hard they come at me.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The harder they come, the harder they fall.""
   - This statement suggests that the intensity or force with which someone or something approaches a situation will directly correlate with the intensity or force of their downfall.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""They will fall softly regardless of how hard they come at me.""
   - This statement suggests that no matter how intense or forceful the approach is, the downfall will be gentle or soft.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a direct correlation between the intensity of the approach and the intensity of the fall.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that the intensity of the fall is independent of the intensity of the approach.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise states that a harder approach results in a harder fall, while the Hypothesis states that the fall will be soft regardless of the approach's intensity.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.""
   - This statement indicates that the presence of ""he"" causes increasing misery over time.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He has a very annoying voice.""
   - This statement suggests that ""he"" possesses a specific characteristic (an annoying voice).

3. **Relation Analysis**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise must directly imply the Hypothesis. The Premise does not explicitly mention anything about ""he"" having an annoying voice. It only mentions that his presence causes misery.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise suggests that ""he"" causes misery, which could be due to various reasons, one of which might be an annoying voice. However, the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny this specific reason.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to imply that ""he"" does not have an annoying voice. The Premise does not provide any information that contradicts the possibility of ""he"" having an annoying voice.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.","If he is around longer today, I will probably not enjoy myself.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.""
   - This statement indicates a direct relationship between the duration of someone's presence and the speaker's level of misery. The longer the person is around, the more miserable the speaker becomes.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis: ""If he is around longer today, I will probably not enjoy myself.""
   - This statement suggests that if the person is around for a longer period today, the speaker will likely not have a good time.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship: longer presence leads to increased misery.
   - The Hypothesis suggests a probable outcome (not enjoying oneself) if the person is around longer today, which aligns with the idea of increased misery.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a logical consequence of the Premise. If the speaker becomes more miserable the longer the person is around, it follows that the speaker will probably not enjoy themselves if the person is around longer today.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.",I'm happiest on the days where he is around a lot.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker's misery increases with the duration of someone's presence.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I'm happiest on the days where he is around a lot.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker's happiness increases with the duration of someone's presence.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker becomes more miserable the longer ""he"" is around.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker is happiest when ""he"" is around a lot.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis present directly opposing emotional responses to the same situation (the presence of ""he"").
   - If the Premise is true (more presence leads to more misery), then the Hypothesis (more presence leads to more happiness) cannot be true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

comparative-correlative,partial,"The more I studied, the less I understood.",I studied a lot for my recent exams.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The more I studied, the less I understood.""
Hypothesis: ""I studied a lot for my recent exams.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise suggests a negative correlation between studying and understanding. It implies that as the amount of studying increased, the level of understanding decreased.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that the person studied a lot for their recent exams. It does not provide any information about the level of understanding achieved.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise does not directly state the amount of studying, but it implies that there was a significant amount of studying (since there was a noticeable effect on understanding).
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states that the person studied a lot.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise would need to explicitly state that the person studied a lot. While the Premise implies significant studying, it does not explicitly quantify it.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise implies significant studying but does not explicitly confirm the exact amount. Therefore, the Hypothesis could be true, but it is not definitively confirmed by the Premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise if the Premise explicitly stated that the person did not study a lot. However, this is not the case here.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more I studied, the less I understood.",I got more confused as I studied.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more I studied, the less I understood.""
   - This statement suggests a negative correlation between studying and understanding. As the amount of studying increases, the level of understanding decreases.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I got more confused as I studied.""
   - This statement suggests that studying led to an increase in confusion.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a negative outcome associated with studying.
   - The Premise indicates a decrease in understanding with more studying.
   - The Hypothesis indicates an increase in confusion with more studying.
   - Decreased understanding and increased confusion are closely related concepts; both imply a lack of clarity or comprehension.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis logically follows because if understanding decreases, it is reasonable to infer that confusion increases.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The more I studied, the less I understood.""
   - This statement indicates a negative correlation between studying and understanding. The speaker is saying that increased studying led to decreased understanding.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""I felt like my studying helped me really grasp the subject.""
   - This statement indicates a positive outcome from studying. The speaker is saying that studying helped them understand the subject well.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise suggests that studying did not help and actually made understanding worse.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that studying was beneficial and improved understanding.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis present opposite outcomes regarding the effect of studying on understanding.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.""
   - This statement suggests that the effectiveness of the drug decreases as the age of the patient increases. It does not provide any information about the drug being harmful, only that it becomes less effective.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""This drug can be harmful for older patients.""
   - This statement suggests that the drug has the potential to cause harm to older patients.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about the drug being less effective for older patients, but it does not mention anything about the drug being harmful.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new concept (harmfulness) that is not addressed in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide any information about the drug being harmful, we cannot definitively say that the Hypothesis is true or false based on the Premise alone.
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as the Premise only discusses effectiveness, not harm.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Final answer:

   - ""It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.""
   - This statement suggests that the drug's effectiveness decreases as the patient's age increases.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""This drug is best suited for treating patients who are on the younger side.""
   - This statement suggests that the drug is more effective for younger patients.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a negative correlation between patient age and drug effectiveness.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that the drug is more effective for younger patients, which aligns with the Premise's implication that the drug is less effective for older patients.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis logically follows. If the drug is less effective for older patients, it is reasonable to conclude that it is better suited for younger patients.

Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.""
   - This statement suggests that the effectiveness of the drug decreases as the age of the patient increases.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Ideally patients that take this drug are advanced in age.""
   - This statement suggests that it is preferable for patients who take this drug to be older.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the drug is less effective for older patients.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that it is ideal for older patients to take this drug.

4. **Inference**:
   - There is a clear contradiction between the two statements. The Premise implies that the drug is less effective for older patients, which would logically mean it is not ideal for older patients to take it. The Hypothesis, on the other hand, states the opposite, that it is ideal for older patients to take the drug.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

### Premise:
""Applied to health care, the longer we wait for it the worse off we are and the longer we put it off the longer it will take to fine tune it.""

### Hypothesis:
""Waiting longer for healthcare will make it more expensive to implement.""

### Analysis:
1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that delaying healthcare has negative consequences: it makes the situation worse and increases the time required to fine-tune the healthcare system.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis suggests that delaying healthcare will increase the cost of implementing it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise does not explicitly mention the cost of healthcare. It focuses on the negative outcomes of delaying healthcare, such as worsening conditions and increased time for fine-tuning.
   - The hypothesis introduces a new aspect (cost) that is not directly addressed in the premise.

### Conclusion:
- Since the premise does not provide information about the cost implications of delaying healthcare, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true or false based on the given premise.
- The hypothesis is plausible but not necessarily entailed by the premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more bureaucrats run charities, the more people who need them.""
   - This statement suggests a correlation between the number of bureaucrats running charities and the number of people who need those charities. It implies that an increase in bureaucratic involvement in charities leads to an increase in the number of people requiring charity services.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Bureaucrats are always greedy.""
   - This statement makes a general claim about the nature of bureaucrats, asserting that they are always greedy.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise discusses the effect of bureaucrats running charities on the number of people needing those charities. It does not make any direct claim about the personal characteristics of bureaucrats, such as greed.
   - The Hypothesis makes a broad generalization about bureaucrats being greedy, which is not directly addressed or implied by the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information that would definitively confirm or deny the Hypothesis. The Premise is about the impact of bureaucrats on charity needs, while the Hypothesis is about the personal trait of greed in bureaucrats.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as there is no direct connection or contradiction between the two statements.

Based on this analysis, the appropriate relation is:

comparative-correlative,partial,"The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.",Senior management is always micromanaging our decisions.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.""
   - This implies that senior management's involvement increases with the cost of the decision. It does not specify that senior management is involved in all decisions, only that their involvement is proportional to the expense.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Senior management is always micromanaging our decisions.""
   - This implies that senior management is involved in every decision, regardless of the cost, and that they are involved to a high degree (micromanaging).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise suggests a conditional involvement of senior management based on the expense of the decision.
   - The hypothesis suggests an unconditional and pervasive involvement of senior management in all decisions.

4. **Inference**:
   - The hypothesis extends the involvement of senior management to all decisions, which is not supported by the premise. The premise only indicates increased involvement with more expensive decisions, not constant involvement in all decisions.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis cannot be true based on the information provided in the premise. Therefore, the relationship is a contradiction.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.""
   - This means that as the cost of a decision increases, the involvement of senior management also increases.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Senior management likes to oversee decisions that are most likely to cost a lot of money.""
   - This suggests that senior management has a preference for overseeing decisions that are expected to be expensive.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states a conditional relationship between the cost of a decision and the involvement of senior management.
   - The Hypothesis suggests a preference or tendency of senior management to oversee expensive decisions.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state that senior management ""likes"" to oversee expensive decisions; it only states that they will be more involved as the cost increases.
   - The Hypothesis introduces the idea of preference (""likes""), which is not directly supported by the Premise.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the Hypothesis.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.""
   - This statement suggests a direct relationship between the cost of a decision and the involvement of senior management. Specifically, it implies that as the cost of a decision increases, senior management's involvement also increases.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Senior management doesn't care much about the cost of potential decisions.""
   - This statement suggests that senior management is indifferent to the cost of decisions, implying that their involvement is not influenced by the cost.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that senior management's involvement is directly related to the cost of decisions (more cost = more involvement).
   - The Hypothesis suggests the opposite, that senior management's involvement is not influenced by the cost of decisions.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise states that cost influences senior management's involvement, while the Hypothesis states that cost does not influence their involvement.

   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise. If completing the task quickly allows the game to proceed, it implies that the task must be done before the game can start.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment

So, the final output is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.",We don't have to do this before the game starts.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.""
   - This implies that there is a task that needs to be completed before proceeding with the game. The emphasis is on completing the task quickly to start the game sooner.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""We don't have to do this before the game starts.""
   - This suggests that the task mentioned in the Premise is not a prerequisite for starting the game.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise implies that the task must be done quickly to proceed with the game, indicating that the task is necessary before the game can start.
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that the task does not need to be done before the game starts.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the implication of the Premise, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.",More snow makes skiers go faster down the slopes.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.""
   - This statement suggests that an increase in snow leads to a decrease in danger for skiers. It implies a positive effect of more snow on skier safety.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""More snow makes skiers go faster down the slopes.""
   - This statement suggests that an increase in snow causes skiers to go faster.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about the relationship between snow and skier safety, indicating that more snow reduces danger.
   - The Hypothesis talks about the relationship between snow and skier speed, indicating that more snow increases speed.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the speed of skiers. It only addresses the safety aspect.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new aspect (speed) that is not covered by the Premise.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide information about skier speed, we cannot definitively determine whether the Hypothesis is true or false based on the Premise alone.
   - Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is Neutral.

Final Relation Output: 1",Final Relation Output: 1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.",It's most safe to ski if there has been a substantial snowfall recently.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.""
   - This suggests that an increase in snowfall correlates with a decrease in danger for skiers.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""It's most safe to ski if there has been a substantial snowfall recently.""
   - This implies that substantial snowfall makes skiing the safest.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates a general trend that more snow leads to less danger.
   - The hypothesis takes this a step further by asserting that substantial snowfall makes skiing the safest.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The hypothesis logically follows from the premise. If more snow leads to less danger, then substantial snowfall (which is a lot of snow) would indeed make skiing safer.
   - There is no information in the premise that contradicts the hypothesis.
   - The hypothesis is a reasonable conclusion based on the premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.",It is too dangerous to ski on days when there was heavy snow recently.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.""
   - This statement suggests that an increase in snow leads to a decrease in danger for skiers. In other words, more snow makes skiing safer.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""It is too dangerous to ski on days when there was heavy snow recently.""
   - This statement suggests that heavy snow makes skiing too dangerous.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that more snow reduces danger for skiers.
   - The Hypothesis states that heavy snow increases danger, making it too dangerous to ski.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis present opposite views on the relationship between snow and skiing danger.
   - According to the Premise, more snow decreases danger, while the Hypothesis claims that heavy snow increases danger.

Given this direct contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis, the relationship is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more they work, the more I will pay them.",My workers always work very hard.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more they work, the more I will pay them.""
   - This statement indicates a conditional relationship between the amount of work done and the payment received. It implies that increased work will result in increased pay.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""My workers always work very hard.""
   - This statement asserts that the workers consistently put in a lot of effort.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the current or usual work habits of the workers. It only states a conditional relationship about payment based on work.
   - The Hypothesis makes a definitive claim about the workers' behavior, stating that they always work very hard.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not entail the Hypothesis because the Premise does not provide enough information to conclude that the workers always work very hard.
   - The Hypothesis is not contradicted by the Premise because the Premise does not provide any information that would make the Hypothesis false.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more they work, the more I will pay them.",I intend to compensate my workers based on their amount of work.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more they work, the more I will pay them.""
   - This statement indicates a direct correlation between the amount of work done and the payment received. It implies that payment is proportional to the amount of work.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I intend to compensate my workers based on their amount of work.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker plans to pay workers according to the amount of work they do. It aligns with the idea of proportional payment based on work done.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states a direct relationship between work and payment.
   - The Hypothesis expresses an intention to pay workers based on the amount of work they do.
   - Both statements convey the same underlying principle: payment is dependent on the amount of work.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because it directly reflects the principle stated in the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more they work, the more I will pay them.",I never pay my workers.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The more they work, the more I will pay them.
Hypothesis: I never pay my workers.

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The Premise states a conditional relationship: if the workers work more, then the speaker will pay them more. This implies that payment is contingent on the amount of work done.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker never pays their workers, which means that regardless of the amount of work done, no payment is made.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise suggests that payment is made based on the amount of work.
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that no payment is made at all.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the conditional payment relationship stated in the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.
