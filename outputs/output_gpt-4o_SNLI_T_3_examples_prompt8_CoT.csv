let-alone,substantive,"A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.",There will be peaceful negotiation of a ceasefire.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.
Hypothesis: There will be peaceful negotiation of a ceasefire.

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The premise states that achieving a ceasefire, and even more so lasting peace, will require long negotiations. This implies that the process is expected to be lengthy and possibly difficult.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The hypothesis suggests that there will be peaceful negotiations to achieve a ceasefire. This implies that the negotiations themselves will be conducted in a peaceful manner.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The premise does not specify the nature of the negotiations (whether they will be peaceful or not), only that they will be long.
   - The hypothesis adds an additional detail by specifying that the negotiations will be peaceful.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The hypothesis is not directly contradicted by the premise, as the premise does not provide information about the nature of the negotiations.
   - The hypothesis is also not entailed by the premise, as the premise does not confirm that the negotiations will be peaceful.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.",Negotiating lasting peace will take less time than negotiating a ceasefire.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

Premise: ""A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.""
- This statement suggests that achieving a ceasefire will require long negotiations, and achieving lasting peace will require even longer negotiations.

Hypothesis: ""Negotiating lasting peace will take less time than negotiating a ceasefire.""
- This statement suggests that negotiating lasting peace will take less time compared to negotiating a ceasefire.

Now, let's determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis:

1. The Premise states that achieving lasting peace will take longer negotiations than achieving a ceasefire.
2. The Hypothesis states the opposite, that negotiating lasting peace will take less time than negotiating a ceasefire.

Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.","It will take long negotiation to achieve a ceasefire, and even longer negotiation to achieve lasting peace.",0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

Premise: A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.
Hypothesis: It will take long negotiation to achieve a ceasefire, and even longer negotiation to achieve lasting peace.

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The premise states that achieving a ceasefire will require long negotiation.
   - It also implies that achieving lasting peace will require even more extensive negotiation.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis states that achieving a ceasefire will require long negotiation.
   - It also states that achieving lasting peace will require even longer negotiation.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis agree that a ceasefire will require long negotiation.
   - Both also agree that lasting peace will require even longer negotiation than a ceasefire.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The hypothesis restates the information given in the premise in a slightly different wording but conveys the same meaning.
   - There is no additional information in the hypothesis that contradicts the premise.
   - The hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:

let-alone,substantive,It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.,Both individuals and society will be consistent after difficulty.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.""
Hypothesis: ""Both individuals and society will be consistent after difficulty.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The premise states that it is challenging for an individual to maintain consistency.
   - It further implies that it is even more challenging for a society to maintain consistency.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis suggests that both individuals and society will achieve consistency after facing difficulty.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The premise emphasizes the difficulty of achieving consistency for both individuals and society.
   - The hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that consistency will be achieved by both individuals and society after difficulty.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. The premise suggests that achieving consistency is very difficult, while the hypothesis claims that consistency will be achieved after difficulty.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.,It is easier for a society to be consistent than an individual.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.""
Hypothesis: ""It is easier for a society to be consistent than an individual.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The premise states that it is difficult for an individual to be consistent.
   - It further implies that it is even more difficult for a society to be consistent.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The hypothesis claims that it is easier for a society to be consistent than an individual.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The premise suggests that consistency is harder for a society compared to an individual.
   - The hypothesis suggests the opposite, that consistency is easier for a society compared to an individual.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. The premise states that societal consistency is more difficult, while the hypothesis states that societal consistency is easier.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.,It is easier for an individual to be consistent than a society.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.""
   - This statement suggests that it is already challenging for an individual to maintain consistency, and it implies that it is even more challenging for a society to do so.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""It is easier for an individual to be consistent than a society.""
   - This statement asserts that it is easier for an individual to maintain consistency compared to a society.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that both an individual and a society find it difficult to be consistent, with the implication that it is even more difficult for a society.
   - The Hypothesis directly states that it is easier for an individual to be consistent than a society.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis aligns with the implication in the Premise that an individual finds it easier to be consistent than a society. The Premise suggests a relative difficulty, which the Hypothesis explicitly states.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,"I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.","I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl living in Ohio.",1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.""
Hypothesis: ""I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl living in Ohio.""

1. **Compare the Statements:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis start with the same phrase: ""I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl...""
   - The difference lies in the ending: 
     - Premise: ""...of your tender years and experience.""
     - Hypothesis: ""...living in Ohio.""

2. **Check for Entailment:**
   - For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, it must be definitely true given the Premise.
   - The Premise does not specify the location of the girl; it only mentions her age and experience.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new detail (living in Ohio) that is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.

3. **Check for Contradiction:**
   - For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, it must be impossible given the Premise.
   - There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the girl living in Ohio. The Premise does not provide any location details that would make the Hypothesis impossible.

4. **Check for Neutral:**
   - For the Hypothesis to be neutral, it must be a statement that may or may not be true given the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new detail (living in Ohio) that is not addressed in the Premise. Therefore, it is possible but not certain based on the information given.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is neutral.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.","I would like to hear of ladies reading anything they like, no matter the age of them.",2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker expresses distress at the idea of any ladies reading ""it"" (presumably a specific text or type of content).
   - The speaker is particularly concerned about a girl of ""tender years and experience"" reading it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The speaker expresses a desire for ladies to read anything they like, regardless of their age.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a restrictive attitude towards what ladies, especially young girls, should read.
   - The Hypothesis indicates a permissive attitude, suggesting that ladies should be free to read anything they like, regardless of age.

4. **Inference**:
   - The attitudes expressed in the Premise and the Hypothesis are directly opposed to each other.
   - The Premise suggests restriction based on age and experience, while the Hypothesis suggests freedom without such restrictions.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because they express contradictory attitudes.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.",I would be distressed to hear of a girl of your tender years and experience reading it.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.""
   - This statement expresses distress at the idea of any ladies reading ""it"" and even more so at a girl of tender years and experience reading ""it.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I would be distressed to hear of a girl of your tender years and experience reading it.""
   - This statement expresses distress specifically at the idea of a girl of tender years and experience reading ""it.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis is a subset of the Premise. The Premise includes a broader group (any ladies) and then narrows down to a specific group (a girl of tender years and experience).
   - The Hypothesis focuses only on the specific group mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise (the Premise explicitly states distress at the idea of a girl of tender years and experience reading ""it""), the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,"None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.",The arguments are not presented in a convincing order.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.""
   - This means that the arguments mentioned are weak and not convincing.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The arguments are not presented in a convincing order.""
   - This suggests that the order of presentation of the arguments is not convincing.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the arguments themselves are weak and not conclusive.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that the lack of convincing nature is due to the order of presentation.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not provide information about the order of the arguments; it only comments on their strength.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new aspect (order of presentation) that is not addressed in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise because the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the order of presentation.

Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.",All of the given arguments are strong and conclusive.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.""
   - This means that all the arguments mentioned are weak and not conclusive.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""All of the given arguments are strong and conclusive.""
   - This means that every argument mentioned is strong and conclusive.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that none of the arguments are strong or conclusive.
   - The Hypothesis claims the exact opposite, that all arguments are strong and conclusive.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise, it cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.",None of these arguments is conclusive.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.""
   - This statement indicates that none of the arguments are strong, and certainly none are conclusive.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""None of these arguments is conclusive.""
   - This statement asserts that none of the arguments are conclusive.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that none of the arguments are conclusive.
   - The Hypothesis also states that none of the arguments are conclusive.

Since the Hypothesis is directly supported by the information given in the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,"Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.",Ambiguous promises given are not to be happily accepted.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.""
Hypothesis: ""Ambiguous promises given are not to be happily accepted.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The premise states that vague promises do not provide a basis for satisfaction or complacency.
   - This implies that vague promises are not sufficient to make someone feel satisfied or complacent.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis states that ambiguous promises are not to be happily accepted.
   - This implies that ambiguous promises should not be accepted with happiness.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis discuss the nature of vague or ambiguous promises.
   - The premise suggests that vague promises do not lead to satisfaction or complacency, which aligns with the idea that they should not be happily accepted.
   - The hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the premise's idea in a slightly different wording.

4. **Determining the Relation:**
   - The hypothesis is definitely true given the premise because it conveys the same idea using different words.
   - There is no contradiction, and the hypothesis is not neutral because it directly follows from the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,"Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.",The speaker is more complacent than satisfied when hearing vague promises.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that vague promises are not grounds for satisfaction, and even less so for complacency.
   - This implies that the speaker finds vague promises insufficient for feeling satisfied and even more insufficient for feeling complacent.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis suggests that the speaker is more complacent than satisfied when hearing vague promises.
   - This implies a comparison where complacency is greater than satisfaction in the context of vague promises.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise clearly states that vague promises are not grounds for satisfaction and even less so for complacency. This means that the level of complacency is lower than the level of satisfaction when it comes to vague promises.
   - The hypothesis contradicts this by suggesting that the speaker is more complacent than satisfied.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise because it reverses the relationship between satisfaction and complacency in the context of vague promises.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.",The promises given are vague and the speaker will not be satisfied nor complacent.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.""
Hypothesis: ""The promises given are vague and the speaker will not be satisfied nor complacent.""

1. **Identify Key Information in the Premise:**
   - The promises are described as ""vague.""
   - These vague promises are stated to be ""no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.""

2. **Identify Key Information in the Hypothesis:**
   - The promises are described as ""vague.""
   - The speaker will ""not be satisfied nor complacent.""

3. **Compare the Information:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that the promises are ""vague.""
   - The Premise states that these vague promises are ""no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency,"" which implies that the speaker will not be satisfied or complacent.
   - The Hypothesis directly states that the speaker will ""not be satisfied nor complacent.""

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is a restatement of the information given in the Premise.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or goes beyond what is stated in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

let-alone,substantive,"Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.",Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to adequately tax the aging population who would be retiring in the near future.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that Mr. Brown claimed the Government had failed to address current failures and future challenges.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that Mr. Brown claimed the Government had failed to adequately tax the aging population who would be retiring in the near future.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise is a general statement about the Government's failure to address both present and future issues.
   - The Hypothesis is a specific claim about the Government's failure to tax the aging population.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis introduces a specific example of a failure (taxing the aging population) that is not mentioned in the Premise.
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the specific claim made in the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.",The Government always owns up to failures committed by them throughout the years and everyone else agrees.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that Mr. Brown claimed the Government had failed to face the failures of the present and the challenges of the future.
   - This implies that, according to Mr. Brown, the Government is not acknowledging or addressing current failures or future challenges.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that the Government always owns up to failures committed by them throughout the years and everyone else agrees.
   - This implies that the Government is consistently acknowledging their failures and there is a consensus on this acknowledgment.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise suggests that the Government is not facing or acknowledging failures.
   - The Hypothesis suggests the opposite, that the Government always acknowledges their failures and there is agreement on this.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the claim made in the Premise. If the Premise is true (the Government is not facing failures), then the Hypothesis (the Government always owns up to failures) cannot be true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.",Mr. Brown stated that the Government is not prepared to face the challenges of the future.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

Premise: ""Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.""

Hypothesis: ""Mr. Brown stated that the Government is not prepared to face the challenges of the future.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - Mr. Brown is making a statement about the Government.
   - He claims that the Government has not addressed current failures.
   - Additionally, he implies that the Government is even less prepared to handle future challenges.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that Mr. Brown said the Government is not prepared to face future challenges.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise includes the idea that the Government has not faced current failures and is not prepared for future challenges.
   - The Hypothesis focuses on the part about the Government not being prepared for future challenges.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise. The Premise explicitly states that the Government is not prepared for future challenges, which is exactly what the Hypothesis claims.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,There must have been text books around at one time but I can not even identify any titles let alone suppliers.,The speaker does not often read text books if they cannot identify any.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""There must have been text books around at one time but I can not even identify any titles let alone suppliers.""

Hypothesis: ""The speaker does not often read text books if they cannot identify any.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The speaker acknowledges that textbooks were present at some point.
   - The speaker admits an inability to identify any titles or suppliers of these textbooks.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The hypothesis suggests that the speaker does not often read textbooks, inferred from their inability to identify any titles.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The premise does not explicitly state the frequency of the speaker's reading habits.
   - The hypothesis makes an assumption based on the speaker's inability to identify textbook titles, which is a reasonable inference but not definitively supported by the premise.

4. **Determining the Relation**:
   - The hypothesis is not directly contradicted by the premise; it is a plausible interpretation.
   - However, the premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm the hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

""I have friends who have been to other countries outside Australia.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The speaker states that the majority of their friends have not traveled outside of Australia.
   - The phrase ""let alone been all over the world"" emphasizes that not only have most friends not left Australia, but they certainly haven't traveled extensively.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis claims that the speaker has friends who have traveled to countries outside of Australia.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The premise indicates that ""most"" friends haven't been outside Australia, which implies that there could be a minority who have traveled outside Australia.
   - The hypothesis states that there are friends who have been to other countries outside Australia, which is not ruled out by the premise.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The premise does not contradict the hypothesis because it allows for the possibility that some friends have traveled outside Australia.
   - The hypothesis is not definitely true based on the premise, but it is possible.

let-alone,substantive,"Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.",I only have friends who have been to countries outside Australia.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.""
   - This means that the majority of the speaker's friends have not traveled outside of Australia. It implies that very few, if any, have traveled internationally.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I only have friends who have been to countries outside Australia.""
   - This means that all of the speaker's friends have traveled internationally, i.e., they have been to countries outside of Australia.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that most friends haven't been outside Australia, suggesting that only a small number, if any, have traveled internationally.
   - The Hypothesis states that all friends have traveled internationally, which directly contradicts the information given in the Premise.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise because the Premise indicates that the majority of friends have not traveled outside Australia, while the Hypothesis claims that all friends have traveled internationally.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Hypothesis: I have a lot of friends who haven't traveled around the world, or even been outside Australia.

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The speaker states that the majority of their friends have not been outside Australia.
   - Additionally, it emphasizes that these friends have not traveled extensively around the world.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker claims to have many friends who have not traveled around the world.
   - It also mentions that these friends have not even been outside Australia.

3. **Comparing the Statements:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same core idea: the speaker's friends have limited travel experience, specifically not having been outside Australia or traveled around the world.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with the same meaning.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - Since the Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise and conveys the same information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment

way-manner,partial,"As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.",She was moving forward when a knight on horseback almost ran her over.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.""
Hypothesis: ""She was moving forward when a knight on horseback almost ran her over.""

1. **Identify the main events in the Premise:**
   - A person (she) is feeling her way forward.
   - Suddenly, a knight on horseback gallops past her.

2. **Identify the main events in the Hypothesis:**
   - The same person (she) is moving forward.
   - A knight on horseback almost runs her over.

3. **Compare the events:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the person moving forward.
   - The Premise states that the knight galloped past her, while the Hypothesis states that the knight almost ran her over.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis implies a close encounter where the knight almost ran her over, which is a plausible interpretation of the knight galloping past her suddenly. The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise but rather provides a more dramatic interpretation of the event.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. It is a plausible scenario but not definitively true or false based on the information provided.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,"As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.","As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback stopped to help her along.",2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

Premise: ""As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.""
- This sentence describes a scenario where a woman is moving forward and a knight on horseback quickly rides past her.

Hypothesis: ""As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback stopped to help her along.""
- This sentence describes a scenario where a woman is moving forward and a knight on horseback stops to assist her.

Now, let's determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis:

1. **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, it must be definitely true given the Premise. In this case, the Premise describes the knight galloping past her, which does not imply that the knight stopped to help her. Therefore, the Hypothesis is not definitely true given the Premise.

2. **Neutral (1)**: For the Hypothesis to be neutral, it must be possible but not certain given the Premise. The Premise does not provide information about the knight stopping to help her; it only mentions the knight galloping past her. It is possible that the knight could have stopped to help her after galloping past, but this is not certain from the information given.

3. **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, it must be impossible given the Premise. The Premise states that the knight galloped past her, which suggests movement away from her, not stopping to help. Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the action described in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,"As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.","As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback went past her.",0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.""
   - This sentence describes a woman moving forward and a knight on horseback galloping past her suddenly.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback went past her.""
   - This sentence describes a woman moving forward and a knight on horseback going past her.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: a woman moving forward and a knight on horseback passing her.
   - The main difference is in the wording: ""felt her way forward"" vs. ""was moving forward"" and ""galloped past her"" vs. ""went past her.""
   - Despite the slight differences in wording, the core event described is the same.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because both describe the same event with no contradictions or additional information that would make the Hypothesis uncertain or false.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

way-manner,partial,If you type in the following program exactly as listed and run it you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.,A snake-like pattern might appear on your screen when you run a specific program into your personal computer.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that if you type in a specific program exactly as listed and run it, you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis suggests that a snake-like pattern might appear on your screen when you run a specific program on your personal computer.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise guarantees that a fascinating pattern will snake its way across the screen if the program is typed and run exactly as listed.
   - The Hypothesis states that a snake-like pattern might appear on the screen when a specific program is run.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise in that it suggests the appearance of a snake-like pattern when a specific program is run.
   - The use of ""might"" in the Hypothesis introduces some uncertainty, but it does not contradict the Premise. It simply does not assert the certainty that the Premise does.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is plausible given the Premise but does not assert the same level of certainty. Therefore, the relationship is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Final answer:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that if you type in a specific program exactly as listed and run it, you will see a fascinating pattern that resembles a snake on your screen.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that nothing shows up on your computer when you run this specific program, and specifically, nothing that resembles a snake.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise asserts that a specific outcome (a snake-like pattern) will definitely appear on the screen when the program is run.
   - The hypothesis asserts the exact opposite, that nothing will appear on the screen, and specifically, nothing resembling a snake.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. The premise guarantees a specific visual outcome, while the hypothesis denies any visual outcome, especially the one described.

### Conclusion:
The hypothesis cannot be true given the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

### Final Answer:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that if you type in a specific program exactly as listed and run it, you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis suggests that a cool snake pattern could appear on your screen when you follow the given program and run it exactly right.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis are essentially describing the same outcome: a pattern that looks like a snake will appear on the screen if the program is typed and run correctly.
   - The Hypothesis uses slightly different wording (""cool snake pattern"" vs. ""fascinating pattern snake""), but the meaning is the same.
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that the pattern will appear if the program is followed exactly.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is one of Entailment.

### Premise:
""Thus a miner who slipped from the worn and greasy rungs was liable to fall a long way and a dropped tool could clatter its way down to cause death or injury to some fellow below.""

### Hypothesis:
""A miner has tools that are valuable and costly to replace if dropped from high above while climbing.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Content Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about the danger of a miner slipping and the potential for a dropped tool to cause injury or death to someone below.
   - The Hypothesis talks about the value and cost of replacing tools if they are dropped from high above while climbing.

2. **Direct Information**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the value or cost of the tools. It only mentions the potential danger of a dropped tool causing injury or death.

3. **Inference Possibility**:
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information about the tools being valuable and costly, which is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.
   - There is no direct contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis, but the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm the Hypothesis either.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the Premise does not confirm or deny the value and cost of the tools, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is Neutral.

way-manner,partial,"She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.","She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension at their suggestion that she go out without a coat.",1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.""
   - This sentence describes a woman who is looking at two people (or objects) and feeling a sense of apprehension that causes a physical reaction (a shiver along her spine).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension at their suggestion that she go out without a coat.""
   - This sentence also describes a woman who is looking at two people (or objects) and feeling apprehension. However, it specifies the cause of her apprehension: a suggestion that she go out without a coat.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same initial action: staring from one to the other and feeling apprehension.
   - The Premise does not specify the cause of the apprehension, while the Hypothesis provides a specific reason (the suggestion to go out without a coat).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis adds additional information (the suggestion to go out without a coat) that is not present in the Premise.
   - The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, but it also does not provide enough information to confirm the specific cause of the apprehension mentioned in the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1 – Neutral

So, the final output is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,"She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.","Staring from one to the other, the girl felt only confidence and strength in her body.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.""
   - The key points here are:
     - The subject (""She"") is staring from one to the other.
     - The subject is feeling apprehension, which is a sense of fear or anxiety.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Staring from one to the other, the girl felt only confidence and strength in her body.""
   - The key points here are:
     - The subject (""the girl"") is also staring from one to the other.
     - The subject is feeling confidence and strength, which are positive emotions.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis describe the subject staring from one to the other.
   - However, the emotions described are completely opposite:
     - Premise: apprehension (negative emotion)
     - Hypothesis: confidence and strength (positive emotions)

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise because it states that the girl felt confidence and strength, whereas the Premise states that she felt apprehension.
   - Since the emotions are mutually exclusive in this context, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,"She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.",She felt apprehension course through her body as she stared from one to the other.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

**Premise:** She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.

**Hypothesis:** She felt apprehension course through her body as she stared from one to the other.

1. **Identify the main components of the Premise:**
   - The subject is ""She.""
   - The actions are ""stared from one to the other"" and ""feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.""

2. **Identify the main components of the Hypothesis:**
   - The subject is ""She.""
   - The actions are ""felt apprehension course through her body"" and ""stared from one to the other.""

3. **Compare the actions and descriptions:**
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis describe the subject feeling apprehension while staring from one to the other.
   - The Premise uses the phrase ""feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine,"" while the Hypothesis uses ""felt apprehension course through her body."" These phrases are semantically similar, both indicating a strong feeling of apprehension affecting the body.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise without introducing any new information or contradictions.
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because it essentially restates the same situation with slightly different wording.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

**Relation: 0**",**Relation: 0**,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.,We picked out all of the best songs from our favorite German operas and sang our way across the rest of Europe.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

**Premise:** We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.

**Hypothesis:** We picked out all of the best songs from our favorite German operas and sang our way across the rest of Europe.

1. **Identify the main actions and subjects in both sentences:**
   - Premise: ""picked out all of the best songs from the tapes"" and ""sang our way across the rest of Europe.""
   - Hypothesis: ""picked out all of the best songs from our favorite German operas"" and ""sang our way across the rest of Europe.""

2. **Compare the actions and subjects:**
   - Both sentences involve picking out songs and singing across Europe.
   - The difference lies in the source of the songs: ""from the tapes"" (Premise) vs. ""from our favorite German operas"" (Hypothesis).

3. **Determine if the Hypothesis can be true given the Premise:**
   - The Premise does not specify the genre or origin of the songs, only that they were from tapes.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that the songs were from German operas, which is a more specific subset of songs that could potentially be on tapes.

4. **Evaluate the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information (the songs being from German operas) that is not explicitly stated in the Premise.
   - This additional information does not contradict the Premise but is not necessarily entailed by it either.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

**Relation: 1**",**Relation: 1**,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.,We sat in uncomfortable silence as we travelled across the rest of Europe.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.""
   - This indicates that the subjects were actively engaging in singing while traveling across Europe.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""We sat in uncomfortable silence as we travelled across the rest of Europe.""
   - This suggests that the subjects were not engaging in any activity (specifically singing) and were instead silent and uncomfortable during their travel.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an active and enjoyable activity (singing) during travel.
   - The Hypothesis describes a passive and unpleasant experience (uncomfortable silence) during travel.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the subjects were singing, they could not have been sitting in uncomfortable silence at the same time.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.,We had tapes playing the best picked songs we sang to across our trip of Europe.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.""
   - This indicates that the speakers selected their favorite songs from tapes and sang these songs while traveling across Europe.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""We had tapes playing the best picked songs we sang to across our trip of Europe.""
   - This suggests that the speakers had tapes playing the selected best songs during their trip across Europe.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention picking the best songs from tapes.
   - The Premise explicitly states that they sang these songs while traveling.
   - The Hypothesis implies that the tapes were playing these songs during the trip, which is consistent with the idea of singing along to the tapes.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise, maintaining the same meaning.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

### Premise:
""She was a big, bosomy woman who couldn't work without a box of biscuits on the desk beside her, and Sarella could hear her now, crunching her way through them.""

### Hypothesis:
""Big, bosomy women love to eat a box of biscuits near them at work, even though coworkers can hear them crunching away the whole time.""

### Analysis:
1. **Specificity vs. Generalization**:
   - The Premise describes a specific woman who needs a box of biscuits on her desk while working and is currently eating them.
   - The Hypothesis generalizes this behavior to all ""big, bosomy women,"" suggesting that they love to eat biscuits at work and that coworkers can hear them.

2. **Evidence in the Premise**:
   - The Premise provides evidence about one specific woman and her behavior.
   - The Hypothesis extends this behavior to a broader group without specific evidence to support such a generalization.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The Premise does not provide information about the preferences or behaviors of all big, bosomy women, only about one individual.
   - The Hypothesis makes a broad generalization that is not supported by the specific instance in the Premise.

### Conclusion:
Given the Premise, the Hypothesis may or may not be true. The Premise does not provide sufficient evidence to definitively support or contradict the generalization made in the Hypothesis. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

### Analysis:
1. **Subject Consistency**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis refer to the same woman described as ""big"" and ""bosomy.""

2. **Key Actions and Conditions**:
   - **Premise**: The woman ""couldn't work without a box of biscuits"" and Sarella ""could hear her now, crunching her way through them.""
   - **Hypothesis**: The woman ""could work without a box of biscuits"" and Sarella ""could hear how quiet it was without her crunching through them.""

3. **Contradiction Check**:
   - The Premise states that the woman ""couldn't work without a box of biscuits,"" implying she needs the biscuits to work.
   - The Hypothesis states the opposite, that the woman ""could work without a box of biscuits,"" implying she does not need the biscuits to work.
   - Additionally, the Premise mentions Sarella hearing the woman crunching through the biscuits, while the Hypothesis mentions Sarella hearing the quietness without the crunching.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise on the woman's ability to work without biscuits and the auditory evidence of her eating them.

1. **Premise**: ""A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.""
   - This indicates that the man successfully entered the room, albeit slowly or carefully.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""A middle-aged man could not get into the room.""
   - This suggests that the man was unable to enter the room.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the man did enter the room.
   - The Hypothesis states that the man could not enter the room.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the man eased his way into the room, it is impossible for it to be true that he could not get into the room.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

way-manner,partial,A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.,A man of maybe fifty years moved carefully into the room.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.
Hypothesis: A man of maybe fifty years moved carefully into the room.

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - ""A middle-aged man"" suggests a man who is likely between 40 and 60 years old.
   - ""eased his way into the room"" implies that the man entered the room carefully or gently.

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - ""A man of maybe fifty years"" suggests a man who is around 50 years old, which falls within the middle-aged range.
   - ""moved carefully into the room"" implies that the man entered the room in a careful manner, which is similar to ""eased his way.""

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - The description of the man in the Hypothesis (""maybe fifty years"") is consistent with the description in the Premise (""middle-aged man"").
   - The action described in the Hypothesis (""moved carefully into the room"") is consistent with the action in the Premise (""eased his way into the room"").

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise with equivalent meaning.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Relation: 0",Relation: 0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.,I yawned three times on my journey to the Narrow Neck.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.""
Hypothesis: ""I yawned three times on my journey to the Narrow Neck.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The speaker is describing their journey back to a place called the Narrow Neck, and they mention yawning during this journey.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The speaker specifies that they yawned three times during their journey to the Narrow Neck.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise indicates that yawning occurred during the journey but does not specify the number of times.
   - The Hypothesis provides a specific number of yawns (three).

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must definitively imply that the speaker yawned exactly three times. The Premise does not provide this level of detail.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it is not necessarily true. The Premise does not specify the number of yawns, so the Hypothesis is a possible scenario but not a certain one.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to imply that yawning three times is impossible or false. The Premise does not provide any information that contradicts the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.,I was energized on my way back to Narrow Neck.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.""
   - This suggests that the speaker was tired or sleepy on their way back to the Narrow Neck.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I was energized on my way back to Narrow Neck.""
   - This suggests that the speaker was full of energy on their way back to the Narrow Neck.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a state of tiredness or sleepiness.
   - The Hypothesis indicates a state of being energized.

4. **Inference**:
   - The states of being tired/sleepy and being energized are mutually exclusive. If someone is yawning (indicating tiredness), they cannot simultaneously be energized.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.,I yawned at least once on my journey back to the Narrow Neck.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.""
Hypothesis: ""I yawned at least once on my journey back to the Narrow Neck.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that the speaker yawned their way back to the Narrow Neck. This implies that yawning occurred during the journey.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that the speaker yawned at least once on their journey back to the Narrow Neck.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise indicates that yawning happened during the journey.
   - The Hypothesis claims that yawning happened at least once during the journey.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If the speaker yawned their way back, it means they yawned multiple times or at least once.
   - Therefore, if the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must also be true because yawning at least once is a subset of yawning multiple times.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

way-manner,partial,It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.,I bought my flight ticket with ease onto the same flight as other passengers.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.""
Hypothesis: ""I bought my flight ticket with ease onto the same flight as other passengers.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The speaker indicates that it was easy to secure a spot on a specific flight.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker claims that they bought their flight ticket with ease onto the same flight as other passengers.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The Premise states that it was easy to get on the flight.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker bought their ticket with ease onto the same flight as other passengers.

4. **Checking for Entailment:**
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with additional detail about ""other passengers,"" which is a reasonable assumption since flights typically have multiple passengers.
   - The core idea that it was easy to get on the flight is preserved in both the Premise and the Hypothesis.

5. **Checking for Contradiction:**
   - There is no information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.

6. **Checking for Neutrality:**
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that is uncertain or unrelated to the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Relation: 0",Relation: 0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.,It was a hard feat to buy my way onto the same flight.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.""
Hypothesis: ""It was a hard feat to buy my way onto the same flight.""

1. **Identify the key information in the Premise:**
   - The action of buying a way onto the same flight is described as ""an easy matter.""

2. **Identify the key information in the Hypothesis:**
   - The action of buying a way onto the same flight is described as ""a hard feat.""

3. **Compare the key information:**
   - The Premise states that buying the way onto the flight was easy.
   - The Hypothesis states that buying the way onto the flight was hard.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The descriptions ""easy matter"" and ""hard feat"" are directly contradictory. If something is easy, it cannot simultaneously be hard.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.,It came easily for me to buy a ticket on the same flight.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.""
Hypothesis: ""It came easily for me to buy a ticket on the same flight.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The speaker is stating that it was easy for them to secure a spot on the same flight, implying that they were able to purchase a ticket without much difficulty.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The speaker is stating that it was easy for them to buy a ticket on the same flight, which is essentially the same idea as the Premise.

3. **Comparing the Statements**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same information: the ease of purchasing a ticket for the same flight. The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is identical.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Since the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and conveys the same information, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.,Constance was looking for first-class carriages to take a ride on.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.""
   - This indicates that Constance is on a platform and is actively searching for first-class carriages.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Constance was looking for first-class carriages to take a ride on.""
   - This suggests that Constance's purpose for looking for the first-class carriages is to take a ride on them.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Constance is looking for first-class carriages.
   - The Hypothesis adds a reason for this action, which is to take a ride on them.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a plausible explanation for why Constance is looking for the first-class carriages, but it is not explicitly stated in the Premise.
   - The Premise does not confirm or deny the reason for Constance's search; it only states the action of looking.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1 – Neutral

So, the final output is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.,Constance waited in line for the first-class carriages.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.""
   - This indicates that Constance is actively moving along the platform and is specifically searching for the first-class carriages.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Constance waited in line for the first-class carriages.""
   - This suggests that Constance is stationary and waiting in a line for the first-class carriages.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes Constance as moving and searching, while the Hypothesis describes her as stationary and waiting.
   - These two actions (moving and searching vs. stationary and waiting) are mutually exclusive in this context. If Constance is moving and searching, she cannot be stationary and waiting at the same time.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis cannot both be true simultaneously, the Hypothesis contradicts the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.,Constance was looking for first-class carriages as she squeezed her way down to the platform.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.
Hypothesis: Constance was looking for first-class carriages as she squeezed her way down to the platform.

1. **Identify the main elements in the Premise:**
   - Constance
   - Squeezed her way down the platform
   - Looking for the first-class carriages

2. **Identify the main elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - Constance
   - Was looking for first-class carriages
   - As she squeezed her way down to the platform

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention Constance.
   - Both statements describe Constance squeezing her way down the platform.
   - Both statements indicate that Constance was looking for first-class carriages.

4. **Check for consistency:**
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise without changing the meaning.
   - The actions and intentions of Constance are the same in both statements.

Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.,The practical man thought about the obstacles to his finding an affordable home.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.
Hypothesis: The practical man thought about the obstacles to his finding an affordable home.

1. **Identify the main elements in the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Premise: A practical man is thinking his way through some apparent obstacles.
   - Hypothesis: The practical man is thinking about obstacles related to finding an affordable home.

2. **Compare the elements:**
   - The Premise mentions ""apparent obstacles"" but does not specify what these obstacles are.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that the obstacles are related to finding an affordable home.

3. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis introduces a specific context (finding an affordable home) that is not mentioned in the Premise.
   - The Premise is more general and does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the specific context of the Hypothesis.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the Premise does not provide enough information to determine whether the obstacles are related to finding an affordable home, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.,The careless man did not have to think about his easy going life.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.
Hypothesis: The careless man did not have to think about his easy going life.

1. **Identify the main subjects and actions in the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Premise: ""The practical man"" is the subject, and ""thought his way through these apparent obstacles"" is the action.
   - Hypothesis: ""The careless man"" is the subject, and ""did not have to think about his easy going life"" is the action.

2. **Compare the subjects:**
   - The Premise talks about a ""practical man,"" while the Hypothesis talks about a ""careless man."" These are two different subjects with contrasting characteristics.

3. **Compare the actions:**
   - In the Premise, the practical man is actively thinking and overcoming obstacles.
   - In the Hypothesis, the careless man is not thinking and has an easy-going life.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The actions and characteristics of the subjects in the Premise and Hypothesis are in direct contrast. The practical man is thoughtful and dealing with obstacles, while the careless man is not thoughtful and has an easy life.
   - Given this contrast, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. The characteristics and actions described are mutually exclusive.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.,The practical man had obstacles he could think his way through.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.""
- This statement indicates that the practical man encountered obstacles and successfully navigated through them by thinking.

Hypothesis: ""The practical man had obstacles he could think his way through.""
- This statement suggests that the practical man had obstacles that he was capable of thinking his way through.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

1. **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise guarantees it. In this case, the Premise states that the practical man thought his way through the obstacles, which implies that he had obstacles he could think his way through. This directly supports the Hypothesis.

2. **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis would be possibly true if the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny it. However, the Premise does provide enough information to confirm the Hypothesis.

3. **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise directly contradicts it. There is no contradiction here; the Premise supports the Hypothesis.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the information provided in the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0

### Premise:
""The research for this article was MADE possible by grants from the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Institute of Turkish Studies, and the Sachar Fund of Brandeis University.""

### Hypothesis:
""The research for this article was MADE possible by record-breakingly enormous grants from the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Institute of Turkish Studies, and the Sachar Fund of Brandeis University.""

### Analysis:
1. **Content Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that the research was made possible by grants from the same three sources: the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Institute of Turkish Studies, and the Sachar Fund of Brandeis University.
   - The Hypothesis adds the qualifier ""record-breakingly enormous"" to describe the grants.

2. **Entailment Check**:
   - For the Hypothesis to be an entailment (0), the Premise must definitively support the additional information in the Hypothesis. In this case, the Premise does not provide any information about the size or record-breaking nature of the grants. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the Premise alone.

3. **Contradiction Check**:
   - For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction (2), the Premise must definitively refute the additional information in the Hypothesis. The Premise does not provide any information that contradicts the size or record-breaking nature of the grants. Therefore, the Hypothesis is not definitively false based on the Premise.

4. **Neutral Check**:
   - For the Hypothesis to be neutral (1), the additional information in the Hypothesis must be possible but not definitively supported or refuted by the Premise. The Premise does not provide any information about the size of the grants, so the Hypothesis could be true or false. Therefore, the Hypothesis is neutral with respect to the Premise.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. Therefore, the relation is neutral.

### Analysis:
1. **Premise** states that the research was made possible by grants from three specific organizations.
2. **Hypothesis** states the exact opposite, that the research was not made possible by grants from those same three organizations.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise. If the Premise is true, the Hypothesis cannot be true.

### Hypothesis:
""The Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Institute of Turkish Studies, and the Sachar Fund of Brandeis University all made grants to a research article that was only possible because of them.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Key Information in the Premise:**
   - The research for the article was made possible by grants.
   - The grants came from three sources: the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Institute of Turkish Studies, and the Sachar Fund of Brandeis University.

2. **Identify Key Information in the Hypothesis:**
   - The same three sources made grants.
   - The research article was only possible because of these grants.

3. **Compare the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The Hypothesis states that the research article was only possible because of the grants from the three mentioned sources.
   - The Premise states that the research was made possible by these grants, which implies that without these grants, the research might not have been possible.

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with a slight emphasis on the exclusivity (""only possible because of them"").
   - The Premise does not explicitly state ""only possible,"" but it strongly implies that the grants were crucial for the research.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. The slight rephrasing does not change the fundamental meaning.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""The Court's apparent detachment from politics is made possible by its nonelective status.""
   - This means that the Court is perceived to be detached from politics because its members are not elected.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that ""The Court's apparent detachment from politics is clear from the stately décor of the courtroom.""
   - This suggests that the detachment from politics is evident from the appearance or decoration of the courtroom.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise attributes the Court's detachment from politics to its nonelective status.
   - The Hypothesis attributes the Court's detachment from politics to the stately décor of the courtroom.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis provide different reasons for the Court's detachment from politics.
   - The Premise does not mention anything about the courtroom's décor, and the Hypothesis does not mention the nonelective status.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as the two statements are not directly related or contradictory.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral

**Hypothesis:** Justin Timberlake sings a hit song in a new rom-com called The Last Drop that deals with alcoholism.

1. **Identify the main elements in the Premise:**
   - Justin Timberlake
   - Makes alcoholism fun
   - New rom-com
   - Title: The Last Drop

2. **Identify the main elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - Justin Timberlake
   - Sings a hit song
   - New rom-com
   - Title: The Last Drop
   - Deals with alcoholism

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis mention Justin Timberlake and the new rom-com titled ""The Last Drop.""
   - The Premise states that Justin Timberlake makes alcoholism fun in the rom-com.
   - The Hypothesis states that Justin Timberlake sings a hit song in the rom-com and that the rom-com deals with alcoholism.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Premise does not mention anything about Justin Timberlake singing a hit song.
   - The Hypothesis adds new information (singing a hit song) that is not present in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis also states that the rom-com deals with alcoholism, which is consistent with the Premise.

Since the Hypothesis introduces new information (singing a hit song) that is not confirmed or denied by the Premise, it is uncertain whether this new information is true or false based on the Premise alone.

   - The Premise states that Justin Timberlake makes alcoholism ""fun,"" while the Hypothesis states he makes it ""interesting.""

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise. The terms ""fun"" and ""interesting"" are not direct contradictions; they can be seen as related or overlapping in meaning.
   - The Hypothesis is not definitively true based on the Premise alone because ""interesting"" is not exactly the same as ""fun,"" but it is close enough to be plausible.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

**Neutral (1)**

Therefore, the relation output is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.,This nice man has a mother who will kiss him to the point of unconsciousness.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.""
   - The key elements here are:
     - A nice man.
     - The man wants Mother to kiss him.
     - The kiss is intended to make him unconscious.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""This nice man has a mother who will kiss him to the point of unconsciousness.""
   - The key elements here are:
     - A nice man.
     - The man has a mother.
     - The mother will kiss him to the point of unconsciousness.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise suggests a desire or intention (""probably just wanted"") for Mother to kiss him unconscious.
   - The Hypothesis states as a fact that the man has a mother who will kiss him to the point of unconsciousness.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not confirm that the man has a mother who will actually kiss him to the point of unconsciousness; it only suggests that he wants this to happen.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is not definitely true based on the Premise. It is possible but not certain.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.,This bad man has a mother that he never wants to lay a kiss on him.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.""
   - The premise describes a ""nice man"" who desires a kiss from ""Mother"" to the extent that it might render him unconscious. The tone suggests a positive or affectionate context.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""This bad man has a mother that he never wants to lay a kiss on him.""
   - The hypothesis describes a ""bad man"" who has a mother but does not want her to kiss him. The tone here is negative and suggests a lack of affection or a strained relationship.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise describes a ""nice man"" who wants a kiss from ""Mother,"" implying a positive relationship.
   - The hypothesis describes a ""bad man"" who does not want a kiss from his mother, implying a negative relationship.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The premise and hypothesis describe two different men with opposite desires regarding a kiss from their mother.
   - The premise suggests a positive relationship, while the hypothesis suggests a negative one.
   - These two statements cannot both be true simultaneously about the same person or context.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.,"This nice man probably just wanted Mother to kiss him, causing him to be unconscious.",0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.""
   - The key elements here are:
     - ""This nice man""
     - ""probably just wanted""
     - ""Mother to KISS him unconscious""

2. **Hypothesis**: ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to kiss him, causing him to be unconscious.""
   - The key elements here are:
     - ""This nice man""
     - ""probably just wanted""
     - ""Mother to kiss him, causing him to be unconscious""

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis talk about the same man and his desire for Mother to kiss him.
   - The Premise uses the phrase ""KISS him unconscious,"" which implies that the kiss would result in him becoming unconscious.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases this as ""kiss him, causing him to be unconscious,"" which conveys the same meaning.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with the same meaning.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.,I had brushed my hair until it felt soft.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.""
   - This indicates that the speaker brushed their hair to achieve a smooth texture.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""I had brushed my hair until it felt soft.""
   - This indicates that the speaker brushed their hair to achieve a soft texture.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise focuses on the hair being ""very smooth.""
   - The Hypothesis focuses on the hair feeling ""soft.""

4. **Analysis:**
   - Smooth and soft are related but not identical attributes. Hair can be smooth without being soft and vice versa.
   - The Premise does not provide information about the hair feeling soft, only that it is smooth.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not confirm or deny the softness of the hair.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.,I had brushed my nonexistent hair roughly.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.
Hypothesis: I had brushed my nonexistent hair roughly.

1. **Check for Entailment (0)**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker brushed their hair very smooth.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker brushed their nonexistent hair roughly.
   - The Hypothesis introduces the idea of ""nonexistent hair,"" which contradicts the Premise's assertion that the speaker has hair to brush.
   - Additionally, the manner of brushing (""very smooth"" vs. ""roughly"") is contradictory.

2. **Check for Neutral (1)**:
   - For the Hypothesis to be neutral, it should be possible but not necessarily true given the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise by stating the hair is nonexistent and brushed roughly, which is not a neutral statement.

3. **Check for Contradiction (2)**:
   - The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise because it directly contradicts the existence of hair and the manner of brushing described in the Premise.

Given the analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.,I had very smooth hair because I brushed it.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.
Hypothesis: I had very smooth hair because I brushed it.

1. **Identify the key information in the Premise:**
   - The action of brushing hair.
   - The result of the action: hair being very smooth.

2. **Identify the key information in the Hypothesis:**
   - The result: having very smooth hair.
   - The cause: brushing the hair.

3. **Compare the information:**
   - The Premise states that the hair was brushed very smooth.
   - The Hypothesis states that the hair is very smooth because it was brushed.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise. If the hair was brushed very smooth, it implies that the hair is very smooth because of the brushing.

Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is:

0 – Entailment

Therefore, the relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,You KILLED it stone-dead.,You killed someone.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""You KILLED it stone-dead.""
Hypothesis: ""You killed someone.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The phrase ""You KILLED it stone-dead"" is an idiomatic expression. It typically means that you did something extremely well or effectively, not that you literally killed something or someone.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The Hypothesis ""You killed someone"" is a literal statement suggesting that a person was killed.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The Premise uses an idiomatic expression that does not imply the literal killing of a person.
   - The Hypothesis interprets the action as a literal killing of a person.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - Since the Premise does not support the literal interpretation of killing someone, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,You KILLED it stone-dead.,You caused it to be more alive.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""You KILLED it stone-dead.""
   - This statement indicates that something was killed and is now completely dead.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""You caused it to be more alive.""
   - This statement suggests that the action taken resulted in something becoming more alive.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that something was killed and is now dead.
   - The Hypothesis states that the same thing was made more alive.

4. **Inference**:
   - If something is killed and is dead, it cannot be more alive. The two statements are mutually exclusive.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,You KILLED it stone-dead.,It was stone-dead as a result of you killing it.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""You KILLED it stone-dead.""
   - This statement indicates that an action (killing) was performed, resulting in something being ""stone-dead.""

2. **Hypothesis**: ""It was stone-dead as a result of you killing it.""
   - This statement suggests that the state of being ""stone-dead"" was a direct consequence of the action of killing performed by ""you.""

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. It states that the result of the action (killing) is the state of being ""stone-dead,"" which is exactly what the Premise conveys.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis. It is a logical conclusion drawn directly from the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The tools were WIPED clean.,The tools were cleaned with a cloth.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""The tools were WIPED clean.""
   - This statement indicates that the tools were cleaned by wiping them.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""The tools were cleaned with a cloth.""
   - This statement suggests that the tools were cleaned using a cloth.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

- **Entailment (0):** The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise implies it directly. In this case, if the tools were wiped clean, it is highly likely that a cloth was used for wiping. However, the Premise does not explicitly state that a cloth was used; it only states that the tools were wiped clean. Wiping generally involves using a cloth, but it is not explicitly mentioned.
  
- **Neutral (1):** The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not specify what was used to wipe the tools clean. While it is common to use a cloth for wiping, it is also possible to use other materials (e.g., paper towels, wipes). Therefore, the Hypothesis is plausible but not certain based on the Premise.

- **Contradiction (2):** The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise directly contradicts it. In this case, there is no direct contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis. The Premise does not provide any information that would make the Hypothesis impossible.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relationship is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,The tools were WIPED clean.,The tools were extremely dirty.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The tools were WIPED clean.
Hypothesis: The tools were extremely dirty.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The statement ""The tools were WIPED clean"" indicates that the tools have been cleaned, implying they are no longer dirty.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The statement ""The tools were extremely dirty"" suggests that the tools are in a state of being very dirty.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise indicates that the tools are clean.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that the tools are extremely dirty.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If the tools are clean (as stated in the Premise), they cannot be extremely dirty (as stated in the Hypothesis).
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

The correct numerical value is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The tools were WIPED clean.,The tools were clean because they were wiped.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The tools were WIPED clean.
Hypothesis: The tools were clean because they were wiped.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that the tools were wiped clean. This means that the action of wiping resulted in the tools being clean.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that the tools were clean because they were wiped. This is essentially providing a reason for why the tools were clean, which is consistent with the information given in the Premise.

3. **Checking for Entailment**: The Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise. The Premise states that the tools were wiped clean, and the Hypothesis explains that the tools were clean because they were wiped. This is a logical conclusion based on the Premise.

4. **Checking for Neutrality**: There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that is not already implied by the Premise. The Hypothesis does not introduce any new elements that could make it uncertain or neutral.

5. **Checking for Contradiction**: There is no contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis. The Hypothesis does not state anything that would be impossible or false given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Relation: 0",Relation: 0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The river FROZE solid.,The river was cold.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The river FROZE solid.""
   - This statement indicates that the river has turned into a solid state due to freezing temperatures.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The river was cold.""
   - This statement suggests that the river had a low temperature.

3. **Relation Analysis**:
   - If a river has frozen solid, it must have been at or below the freezing point of water, which is a very low temperature. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the river was indeed cold.
   - The Hypothesis is a less specific statement that is logically implied by the Premise. If the river froze solid, it must have been cold.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The river FROZE solid.,The river had melted into liquid.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The river FROZE solid.""
   - This statement indicates that the river has turned into a solid state due to freezing.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The river had melted into liquid.""
   - This statement indicates that the river has turned into a liquid state due to melting.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the river is in a solid state (frozen).
   - The Hypothesis states that the river is in a liquid state (melted).

4. **Inference**:
   - A river cannot be both frozen solid and melted into liquid at the same time. These two states are mutually exclusive.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The river FROZE solid.,The river is frozen solid.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The river FROZE solid.
Hypothesis: The river is frozen solid.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that the river ""froze solid,"" which means that at some point in time, the river became completely frozen.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that the river ""is frozen solid,"" which means that the current state of the river is completely frozen.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise indicates a past event where the river became frozen solid.
   - The Hypothesis indicates the current state of the river being frozen solid.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Premise does not provide information about the current state of the river. It only tells us that at some point, the river froze solid.
   - The Hypothesis makes a claim about the current state of the river, which is not necessarily implied by the Premise. The river could have thawed since it froze solid.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is Neutral.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,It BROKE apart.,It broke into pieces by hand.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""It BROKE apart.""
   - This statement indicates that something has broken into separate parts. The cause or method of breaking is not specified.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""It broke into pieces by hand.""
   - This statement specifies that the breaking into pieces was done by hand.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that something broke apart, but it does not provide any information about how it broke apart.
   - The Hypothesis adds additional information by specifying that the breaking was done by hand.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the breaking was done by hand. Since the Premise does not specify the method of breaking, we cannot definitively conclude this.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, but it also does not provide enough information to confirm it. Therefore, the Hypothesis is a possible scenario but not a certain one.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that directly conflicts with the Hypothesis. Since the Premise does not specify how the breaking occurred, there is no direct conflict.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,It BROKE apart.,It was put together.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""It BROKE apart.""
Hypothesis: ""It was put together.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The phrase ""It BROKE apart"" indicates that something that was once whole has now been separated into pieces.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The phrase ""It was put together"" suggests that something has been assembled or combined into a whole.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise indicates a state of being broken or separated.
   - The Hypothesis indicates a state of being assembled or combined.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - If something is broken apart, it cannot simultaneously be put together. These two states are mutually exclusive.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,It BROKE apart.,It was severed into more than one piece.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""It BROKE apart.""
   - This indicates that something has broken into pieces.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""It was severed into more than one piece.""
   - This suggests that something was cut or split into multiple pieces.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise states that something broke apart, which implies it is now in multiple pieces.
   - The Hypothesis states that something was severed into more than one piece, which also implies it is now in multiple pieces.

4. **Inference:**
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. Both indicate that the object is now in multiple pieces.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,He HAMMERED the metal flat.,He was making a sword by hammering metal.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: He HAMMERED the metal flat.
Hypothesis: He was making a sword by hammering metal.

1. **Identify the main action in the Premise:**
   - The main action is ""hammered the metal flat.""

2. **Identify the main action in the Hypothesis:**
   - The main action is ""making a sword by hammering metal.""

3. **Compare the actions and context:**
   - The Premise states that the metal was hammered flat, but it does not specify the purpose of hammering the metal.
   - The Hypothesis suggests a specific purpose for hammering the metal, which is making a sword.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny that the metal was being hammered to make a sword. It only states that the metal was hammered flat.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. There is no direct contradiction, nor is there a definite entailment.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,He HAMMERED the metal flat.,He enflated the metal into a balloon.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He HAMMERED the metal flat.""
   - This indicates that the person used a hammer to make the metal flat. The action of hammering typically involves applying force to flatten or shape the metal.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He enflated the metal into a balloon.""
   - This suggests that the person somehow made the metal expand into a balloon-like shape. The term ""enflated"" (likely a typo for ""inflated"") implies expanding something with air or gas, which is the opposite of flattening.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an action that results in the metal becoming flat.
   - The Hypothesis describes an action that results in the metal becoming balloon-like, which is an expansion and the opposite of flattening.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are contradictory. Flattening the metal and inflating it into a balloon are mutually exclusive outcomes.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,He HAMMERED the metal flat.,He flattened the metal by hammering.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He HAMMERED the metal flat.""
   - This sentence states that an individual used a hammer to make the metal flat.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""He flattened the metal by hammering.""
   - This sentence states that an individual made the metal flat by using a hammer.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action: using a hammer to make the metal flat.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the action described in the Premise but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (it is essentially a restatement of the Premise), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The dog BARKED the chickens awake.,The dog likes to wake the chickens up by barking.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

Premise: The dog BARKED the chickens awake.
Hypothesis: The dog likes to wake the chickens up by barking.

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - The dog barked.
   - The barking woke the chickens.

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - The dog likes to wake the chickens up.
   - The method of waking the chickens is by barking.

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - The Premise states a specific event: the dog barked and as a result, the chickens woke up.
   - The Hypothesis makes a general statement about the dog's behavior and preference: the dog likes to wake the chickens up by barking.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Premise does not provide information about the dog's preferences or habits; it only describes a single event.
   - The Hypothesis introduces an additional element of the dog's liking or habitual behavior, which is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the general behavior or preference of the dog.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is Neutral.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,The dog BARKED the chickens awake.,The dog was silent because there were chickens.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The dog BARKED the chickens awake.
- This indicates that the dog made a loud noise (barked) which caused the chickens to wake up.

Hypothesis: The dog was silent because there were chickens.
- This suggests that the dog did not make any noise (was silent) due to the presence of chickens.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

1. **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis must be definitely true given the Premise. In this case, the Premise states that the dog barked, which directly contradicts the Hypothesis that the dog was silent. Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be definitely true given the Premise.

2. **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Premise did not provide enough information to confirm or deny the Hypothesis. However, the Premise explicitly states that the dog barked, which provides enough information to contradict the Hypothesis.

3. **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. Since the Premise states that the dog barked and the Hypothesis states that the dog was silent, these two statements are directly contradictory.

Given the analysis, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The dog BARKED the chickens awake.,The chickens woke to the dog's bark.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The dog BARKED the chickens awake.
Hypothesis: The chickens woke to the dog's bark.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that the dog barked, and as a result, the chickens woke up. This implies a cause-and-effect relationship where the dog's barking caused the chickens to wake up.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that the chickens woke up because of the dog's bark. This also implies a cause-and-effect relationship where the dog's barking caused the chickens to wake up.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event and cause-and-effect relationship. The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise.

4. **Determining the Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. Since the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise, it is definitely true.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. This is not applicable here because the Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. This is not applicable here because there is no contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis.

Based on the analysis, the correct relation is:

resultative,schematic,Terry WIPED the table clean.,Terry had cleaned the table to eat.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: Terry WIPED the table clean.
Hypothesis: Terry had cleaned the table to eat.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise states that Terry wiped the table clean. This action implies that the table was cleaned by Terry.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis suggests that Terry cleaned the table with the purpose of eating.

3. **Checking for Entailment**: For the hypothesis to be an entailment, the premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that Terry cleaned the table specifically to eat. The premise only states that Terry wiped the table clean, but it does not provide any information about the reason or purpose behind this action.

4. **Checking for Contradiction**: For the hypothesis to be a contradiction, the premise must provide information that directly opposes the hypothesis. The premise does not provide any information that contradicts the idea that Terry cleaned the table to eat.

5. **Checking for Neutrality**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the purpose behind Terry's action of cleaning the table. Therefore, the hypothesis is a possibility but not a certainty.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

resultative,schematic,Terry WIPED the table clean.,Terry wiped the table with a greasy rag until it was black.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Terry WIPED the table clean.""
   - This statement indicates that Terry performed an action (wiping) that resulted in the table being clean.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Terry wiped the table with a greasy rag until it was black.""
   - This statement suggests that Terry used a greasy rag to wipe the table, and as a result, the table became black.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the table ended up clean after Terry wiped it.
   - The Hypothesis states that the table ended up black after Terry wiped it with a greasy rag.

4. **Inference**:
   - The two statements are contradictory because the Premise indicates a clean table, while the Hypothesis indicates a dirty (black) table.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Terry WIPED the table clean.,The table was clean because Terry wiped it down.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Terry WIPED the table clean.""
   - This statement indicates that Terry performed an action (wiping) that resulted in the table being clean.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The table was clean because Terry wiped it down.""
   - This statement suggests that the table's cleanliness is a result of Terry's action of wiping it down.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

- **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. If Terry wiped the table clean, it logically follows that the table was clean because Terry wiped it down. The Hypothesis directly follows from the Premise.
- **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Premise did not provide enough information to confirm the Hypothesis.
- **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Premise and Hypothesis were in direct conflict.

Given that the action described in the Premise (Terry wiping the table clean) directly leads to the state described in the Hypothesis (the table being clean because of Terry's action), the relationship is one of **Entailment**.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,Terry PUSHED the door shut.,Terry closed the door with his side.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Terry PUSHED the door shut.""
   - This statement indicates that Terry used force to close the door. The method of applying force is not specified beyond the fact that it was a push.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Terry closed the door with his side.""
   - This statement specifies that Terry used his side to close the door. 

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that Terry pushed the door shut, which is a general action.
   - The Hypothesis provides a specific method (using his side) to perform the action of pushing the door shut.
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise because using one's side to push the door shut is a plausible method of pushing.
   - However, the Premise does not explicitly state that Terry used his side, so we cannot definitively conclude that the Hypothesis is true based solely on the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1 – Neutral

The final output is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Terry PUSHED the door shut.,Terry opened the door wide.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: Terry PUSHED the door shut.
Hypothesis: Terry opened the door wide.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The action described is ""Terry PUSHED the door shut."" This means that Terry applied force to close the door.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The action described is ""Terry opened the door wide."" This means that Terry applied force to open the door fully.

3. **Comparing the Actions**:
   - The action of pushing the door shut (closing it) is directly opposite to the action of opening the door wide (opening it fully).
   - These two actions cannot happen simultaneously or in the same context without contradicting each other.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - Since the actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are mutually exclusive (one cannot be true if the other is true), the relationship between them is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Terry PUSHED the door shut.,Terry shut the door by pushing it closed.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: Terry PUSHED the door shut.
Hypothesis: Terry shut the door by pushing it closed.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that Terry performed an action where he pushed the door until it was shut.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that Terry shut the door, and the method he used to shut it was by pushing it closed.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The action described in the Hypothesis (""shut the door by pushing it closed"") is essentially a rephrasing of the action described in the Premise (""pushed the door shut"").
   - Both statements describe the same event and method of closing the door.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,He ATE himself sick.,He ate questionably fresh shellfish.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He ATE himself sick.""
   - This means that the person ate so much or something so bad that it made him sick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""He ate questionably fresh shellfish.""
   - This suggests that the person ate shellfish that might not have been fresh, which could potentially make someone sick.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the person became sick from eating.
   - The Hypothesis provides a possible reason for why the person became sick (eating questionably fresh shellfish).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a plausible explanation for the Premise but is not definitively stated in the Premise.
   - The Premise does not specify what was eaten or the condition of the food, only that eating led to sickness.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,He ATE himself sick.,He didn't eat.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""He ATE himself sick.""
Hypothesis: ""He didn't eat.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that ""He ATE himself sick,"" which means he ate so much that it made him feel sick. This clearly indicates that he did eat, and he ate a lot.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states ""He didn't eat,"" which means he did not consume any food.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**: 
   - The Premise indicates that he ate a lot.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that he did not eat at all.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - If the Premise is true (he ate a lot), then the Hypothesis (he didn't eat) cannot be true.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,He ATE himself sick.,He felt sick from eating.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""He ATE himself sick.""
   - This means that the person ate so much that it caused them to feel sick.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""He felt sick from eating.""
   - This means that the person felt sick as a result of eating.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

- The Premise states that the person ate to the point of feeling sick.
- The Hypothesis states that the person felt sick because of eating.

Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because the act of eating led to the person feeling sick, which is directly stated in the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,She COUGHED herself sick.,She coughed too much from choking.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: She COUGHED herself sick.
Hypothesis: She coughed too much from choking.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise states that ""She COUGHED herself sick,"" which means that she coughed so much that it made her ill.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis states that ""She coughed too much from choking,"" which implies that the excessive coughing was a result of choking.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The premise does not specify the cause of the coughing; it only states the result (she became sick from coughing).
   - The hypothesis introduces a specific cause for the coughing (choking).

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be an entailment, the premise must definitively imply the hypothesis. In this case, the premise does not specify the cause of the coughing, so it does not definitively imply that she was choking.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis could be true given the premise, but it is not necessarily true. The premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the cause of the coughing.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the hypothesis to be a contradiction, the premise must definitively rule out the hypothesis. The premise does not provide any information that contradicts the hypothesis.

Given that the premise does not specify the cause of the coughing and the hypothesis introduces a possible cause, the relationship is neutral.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,She COUGHED herself sick.,Her coughing resulted in her feeling better.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""She COUGHED herself sick.""
   - This indicates that the act of coughing led to her becoming sick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""Her coughing resulted in her feeling better.""
   - This suggests that the act of coughing led to an improvement in her health.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that coughing made her sick.
   - The Hypothesis states that coughing made her feel better.

4. **Inference**:
   - The two statements are directly contradictory. The Premise indicates a negative outcome (sickness) due to coughing, while the Hypothesis indicates a positive outcome (feeling better) due to coughing.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,She COUGHED herself sick.,She got sick from coughing.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: She COUGHED herself sick.
Hypothesis: She got sick from coughing.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise states that the action of coughing led to the person becoming sick. The phrase ""COUGHED herself sick"" implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship where coughing is the cause and becoming sick is the effect.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis states that the person got sick as a result of coughing. This also implies a cause-and-effect relationship where coughing is the cause and becoming sick is the effect.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**: Both the premise and the hypothesis describe the same cause-and-effect relationship. The premise explicitly states that coughing led to sickness, and the hypothesis restates this relationship in a slightly different wording.

4. **Determining the Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The hypothesis is definitely true given the premise. Since the premise directly states that coughing caused the sickness, the hypothesis is a restatement of this fact.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. This is not applicable here because the hypothesis directly follows from the premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The hypothesis cannot be true given the premise. This is not applicable here because the hypothesis is consistent with the premise.

Since the hypothesis is a direct restatement of the cause-and-effect relationship described in the premise, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.,The jackhammer pounding sometimes reaches 130 decibels.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.
Hypothesis: The jackhammer pounding sometimes reaches 130 decibels.

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The premise states that the jackhammer was so loud that it made the people deaf.
   - This implies that the jackhammer produced a very high level of noise.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The hypothesis states that the jackhammer pounding sometimes reaches 130 decibels.
   - This is a specific claim about the noise level produced by the jackhammer.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The premise does not provide any specific decibel measurement but indicates an extremely high noise level.
   - The hypothesis provides a specific measurement (130 decibels) which is consistent with the idea of a very loud noise.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The hypothesis is plausible given the premise, but the premise does not confirm the specific decibel level mentioned in the hypothesis.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information given in the premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral

So, the final output is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.,The jackhammer was easy on our ears.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.
Hypothesis: The jackhammer was easy on our ears.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise states that the jackhammer was extremely loud, to the point of making people deaf. This implies a very high level of noise and discomfort.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis states that the jackhammer was easy on our ears, which implies that the jackhammer was not loud and did not cause discomfort.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The premise describes a situation where the jackhammer is extremely loud and causes significant auditory discomfort.
   - The hypothesis describes a situation where the jackhammer is not loud and does not cause auditory discomfort.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. If the jackhammer pounded people deaf, it cannot simultaneously be easy on their ears.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct relation is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.,We were deaf from the jackhammering.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.""
   - This sentence indicates that the noise from the jackhammer was so loud that it caused deafness.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""We were deaf from the jackhammering.""
   - This sentence states that the cause of deafness was the jackhammering.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the jackhammer caused deafness.
   - The Hypothesis states that the jackhammering caused deafness.
   - Both sentences convey the same cause-and-effect relationship: the jackhammering caused deafness.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (both state the same cause and effect), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,Water FILLED the tub half full.,The half-full tub was dirty.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: Water FILLED the tub half full.
Hypothesis: The half-full tub was dirty.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise states that water filled the tub to the halfway point. It provides information about the level of water in the tub but does not give any information about the cleanliness of the tub.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis states that the half-full tub was dirty. This statement is about the cleanliness of the tub, which is not mentioned in the premise.

3. **Checking for Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be entailed by the premise, the premise must provide enough information to conclude that the tub was dirty. Since the premise only talks about the water level and not the cleanliness, the hypothesis is not definitely true given the premise.

4. **Checking for Contradiction (2)**: For the hypothesis to be a contradiction, the premise must provide information that directly opposes the hypothesis. The premise does not provide any information about the cleanliness of the tub, so it does not contradict the hypothesis.

5. **Checking for Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. Since the premise does not provide any information about the cleanliness of the tub, the hypothesis could be true or false independently of the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is Neutral.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Water FILLED the tub half full.,Water drained from the tub.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: Water FILLED the tub half full.
Hypothesis: Water drained from the tub.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise states that water has filled the tub to the halfway point. This implies that the tub is currently half full of water.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis states that water drained from the tub. This implies that water has been removed from the tub, which is a different action from filling it.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The premise describes an action of adding water to the tub.
   - The hypothesis describes an action of removing water from the tub.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - If water is being added to the tub (filling), it contradicts the idea that water is being removed (draining).
   - Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be true if the premise is true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Water FILLED the tub half full.,The tub was half full of water.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: Water FILLED the tub half full.
Hypothesis: The tub was half full of water.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The statement ""Water FILLED the tub half full"" indicates that water was added to the tub until it reached the halfway mark.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The statement ""The tub was half full of water"" describes the state of the tub, specifically that it contains water up to the halfway point.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise describes an action (filling) that results in the tub being half full of water.
   - The Hypothesis describes the resulting state of the tub (half full of water).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a direct description of the state resulting from the action described in the Premise.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or goes beyond what is stated in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

resultative,schematic,The sleeping pills MADE me sick.,I took sleeping pills before bed.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The sleeping pills MADE me sick.""
Hypothesis: ""I took sleeping pills before bed.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The statement indicates that the speaker took sleeping pills and as a result, they felt sick. The key information here is the cause-effect relationship between taking sleeping pills and feeling sick.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The statement suggests that the speaker took sleeping pills before going to bed. It does not mention any effect or consequence of taking the pills.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise implies that the speaker took sleeping pills (since they felt sick because of them).
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker took sleeping pills before bed, which is a specific time frame.

4. **Inference Analysis**:
   - The Premise does not specify the time when the sleeping pills were taken, only that they caused sickness.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a specific time frame (before bed) which is not mentioned in the Premise.

Given the information:
- The Hypothesis is plausible given the Premise, but it is not definitively true because the Premise does not specify when the pills were taken.
- The Hypothesis is not contradicted by the Premise either.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,The sleeping pills MADE me sick.,The sleeping pills make me feel good.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The sleeping pills MADE me sick.
Hypothesis: The sleeping pills make me feel good.

1. **Identify the key information in the Premise:**
   - The subject is ""The sleeping pills.""
   - The action or effect is ""MADE me sick.""

2. **Identify the key information in the Hypothesis:**
   - The subject is ""The sleeping pills.""
   - The action or effect is ""make me feel good.""

3. **Compare the key information:**
   - The Premise states that the sleeping pills caused sickness.
   - The Hypothesis states that the sleeping pills cause a feeling of goodness.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The effects described in the Premise and Hypothesis are directly contradictory. Feeling sick and feeling good are opposite states.
   - Therefore, if the Premise is true (the sleeping pills made the person sick), the Hypothesis cannot be true (the sleeping pills make the person feel good).

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The sleeping pills MADE me sick.,I was sick from the sleeping pills I took.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The sleeping pills MADE me sick.
Hypothesis: I was sick from the sleeping pills I took.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The statement ""The sleeping pills MADE me sick"" indicates that the speaker took sleeping pills and as a result, they became sick. The cause of the sickness is explicitly stated to be the sleeping pills.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The statement ""I was sick from the sleeping pills I took"" suggests that the speaker took sleeping pills and as a result, they became sick. This also indicates a cause-and-effect relationship where the sleeping pills caused the sickness.

3. **Comparing the Statements**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same cause-and-effect relationship: taking sleeping pills resulted in sickness. The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. Since both statements describe the same situation and cause-and-effect relationship, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. This is not applicable here because the Hypothesis directly follows from the Premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. This is not applicable here because there is no contradiction between the statements.

Given the analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

resultative,schematic,Harry SHOT Sam dead.,Harry hated Sam all of his life.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Harry SHOT Sam dead.""
   - This statement indicates a specific action where Harry killed Sam by shooting him.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Harry hated Sam all of his life.""
   - This statement suggests that Harry had a long-standing hatred for Sam.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

- **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must definitively imply that Harry hated Sam all of his life. The Premise only states that Harry shot Sam dead, which does not necessarily mean Harry hated Sam all of his life. There could be other reasons for the shooting.

- **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information about Harry's feelings towards Sam throughout his life. It is possible that Harry hated Sam all of his life, but it is also possible that he did not.

- **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must make it impossible for the Hypothesis to be true. The Premise does not provide any information that directly contradicts the idea that Harry hated Sam all of his life.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relationship is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

Premise: Harry SHOT Sam dead.
Hypothesis: Harry saved Sam's life.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise states that Harry shot Sam, resulting in Sam's death. This is a clear and definitive action with a fatal outcome.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis claims that Harry saved Sam's life. This implies that Sam's life was preserved or protected by Harry.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The premise indicates that Sam is dead because Harry shot him.
   - The hypothesis suggests that Sam is alive because Harry saved him.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - If Sam is dead (as stated in the premise), it is impossible for Harry to have saved his life (as stated in the hypothesis).
   - Therefore, the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Premise: Harry SHOT Sam dead.
Hypothesis: Sam died from the shot Harry took.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise states that Harry shot Sam and as a result, Sam is dead. This is a clear and direct statement indicating the cause (Harry shot) and the effect (Sam is dead).

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis states that Sam died from the shot Harry took. This hypothesis is essentially rephrasing the premise, indicating that the cause of Sam's death was the shot taken by Harry.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**: 
   - The premise directly states that Harry shot Sam dead.
   - The hypothesis states that Sam died as a result of the shot taken by Harry.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The hypothesis is a direct consequence of the premise. If Harry shot Sam dead, it logically follows that Sam died from the shot Harry took.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

resultative,schematic,Sam TALKED himself hoarse.,Sam likes to talk.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: Sam TALKED himself hoarse.
Hypothesis: Sam likes to talk.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise states that Sam talked so much that he became hoarse. This implies that Sam engaged in a significant amount of talking.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis suggests that Sam likes to talk.

3. **Evaluating the Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be definitely true given the premise, the premise must provide conclusive evidence that Sam likes to talk. While the premise indicates that Sam talked a lot, it does not necessarily mean he likes to talk. He could have talked a lot for various reasons (e.g., necessity, obligation, or a specific situation).
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise suggests that Sam talked a lot, which could imply that he likes to talk, but it is not definitive. There could be other reasons for his extensive talking.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the hypothesis to be false given the premise, the premise would need to indicate that Sam does not like to talk. The premise does not provide any information that contradicts the hypothesis.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

resultative,schematic,Sam TALKED himself hoarse.,Sam's talking made his voice clearer.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: Sam TALKED himself hoarse.
- This means that Sam talked so much that his voice became hoarse, which implies his voice became rough or strained.

Hypothesis: Sam's talking made his voice clearer.
- This suggests that Sam's talking resulted in his voice becoming clearer, which is the opposite of becoming hoarse.

Now, let's determine the relationship:
1. **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis must be definitely true given the Premise. In this case, the Premise suggests Sam's voice became hoarse, not clearer. Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be definitely true.
2. **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. However, the Premise directly implies a condition (hoarse) that contradicts the Hypothesis (clearer).
3. **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. Since a hoarse voice is the opposite of a clearer voice, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Given this analysis, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Sam TALKED himself hoarse.,Sam's voice was hoarse from talking.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

   - ""Sam TALKED himself hoarse.""
   - This means that Sam talked so much that his voice became hoarse.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Sam's voice was hoarse from talking.""
   - This means that the reason Sam's voice is hoarse is due to talking.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Sam talked himself hoarse, which directly implies that his voice became hoarse because of talking.
   - The Hypothesis states that Sam's voice was hoarse from talking, which is essentially a restatement of the cause-and-effect relationship described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true. The Premise provides a direct cause (talking) and effect (hoarse voice) relationship that matches the Hypothesis.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.,His house was previously a darker color.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.
Hypothesis: His house was previously a darker color.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that ""He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red."" This indicates that the house is now a bright shade of red due to the action of painting.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that ""His house was previously a darker color."" This suggests that before the house was painted a bright shade of red, it was a darker color.

3. **Evaluating the Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, it must be definitely true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide any information about the previous color of the house. It only states the current color after painting.
   - **Neutral (1)**: For the Hypothesis to be neutral, it may or may not be true given the Premise. Since the Premise does not specify the previous color of the house, the Hypothesis could be true (the house might have been a darker color) or false (the house might have been a lighter color or the same bright shade).
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, it must be definitely false given the Premise. There is no information in the Premise that directly contradicts the Hypothesis.

Given that the Premise does not provide any information about the previous color of the house, the Hypothesis may or may not be true.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.,He scraped off the red paint from his house.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.""
   - This statement indicates that the person applied red paint to his house.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""He scraped off the red paint from his house.""
   - This statement indicates that the person removed the red paint from his house.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the house was painted red.
   - The Hypothesis states that the red paint was removed from the house.

4. **Inference Analysis**:
   - If the house was painted red (Premise), it cannot simultaneously be true that the red paint was scraped off (Hypothesis) without some additional context or time lapse. The two actions are contradictory if considered in the same timeframe.

Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

**Conclusion**: The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

**Relation Output**: 2",**Relation Output**: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.,His house was bright red from paint.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.
Hypothesis: His house was bright red from paint.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that someone painted their house a bright shade of red. This implies that the house is now a bright shade of red due to the paint.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that the house was bright red from paint. This suggests that the house is bright red and the reason for this color is paint.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise indicates an action (painting) that resulted in the house being a bright shade of red.
   - The Hypothesis describes the current state of the house (bright red) and attributes it to paint.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because the action of painting the house a bright shade of red directly leads to the house being bright red from paint.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,She KICKED the door open.,She needed to get into the house quickly.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: She KICKED the door open.
Hypothesis: She needed to get into the house quickly.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The action described is ""She KICKED the door open."" This suggests a forceful and urgent action to open the door.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The statement ""She needed to get into the house quickly"" implies a sense of urgency or necessity for entering the house.

3. **Checking for Entailment**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must definitively imply that she needed to get into the house quickly. While kicking a door open does suggest urgency, it does not definitively prove the necessity of entering the house quickly. There could be other reasons for kicking the door open (e.g., frustration, anger, or an emergency unrelated to entering quickly).

4. **Checking for Contradiction**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must definitively imply that she did not need to get into the house quickly. The Premise does not provide any information that contradicts the need to get into the house quickly.

5. **Checking for Neutrality**: For the Hypothesis to be neutral, the Premise must allow for the possibility that the Hypothesis may or may not be true. Given that kicking a door open suggests urgency but does not definitively prove the need to get into the house quickly, the Hypothesis is plausible but not certain.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,She KICKED the door open.,She slowly opened the door.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: She KICKED the door open.
Hypothesis: She slowly opened the door.

1. **Identify the action in the Premise:**
   - The action described is ""kicked the door open,"" which implies a forceful and sudden action.

2. **Identify the action in the Hypothesis:**
   - The action described is ""slowly opened the door,"" which implies a gentle and gradual action.

3. **Compare the actions:**
   - ""Kicked the door open"" and ""slowly opened the door"" are contradictory actions. One implies a sudden, forceful action, while the other implies a gentle, gradual action.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - Since the actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are mutually exclusive, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,She KICKED the door open.,The door was open from her kick.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""She KICKED the door open.""
   - This statement indicates that a person used a kicking action to open a door.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The door was open from her kick.""
   - This statement suggests that the door became open as a result of her kick.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The action described in the Premise (kicking the door open) directly leads to the state described in the Hypothesis (the door being open from her kick).
   - There is a clear cause-and-effect relationship between the two statements.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

The numerical value corresponding to Entailment is **0**.

conative,partial,She tugged at the glass door.,She had a sliding glass door to her backyard.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: She tugged at the glass door.
Hypothesis: She had a sliding glass door to her backyard.

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - The subject is ""She.""
   - The action is ""tugged at.""
   - The object is ""the glass door.""

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - The subject is ""She.""
   - The possession is ""had a sliding glass door.""
   - The location is ""to her backyard.""

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - The Premise mentions a ""glass door"" but does not specify if it is a sliding door or if it leads to the backyard.
   - The Hypothesis adds additional details that are not present in the Premise: specifically, that the glass door is a sliding door and that it leads to the backyard.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information that is not confirmed or denied by the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to conclude whether the glass door is sliding or leads to the backyard.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,She tugged at the glass door.,She made no motion towards the glass door.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""She tugged at the glass door.""
   - This indicates that the subject (she) made a physical action towards the glass door, specifically tugging at it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""She made no motion towards the glass door.""
   - This indicates that the subject (she) did not make any physical action towards the glass door.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that she did make a motion towards the glass door (tugging at it).
   - The Hypothesis states that she did not make any motion towards the glass door.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If she tugged at the glass door, it is impossible that she made no motion towards it.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,She tugged at the glass door.,She attempted to tug the glass door.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: She tugged at the glass door.
Hypothesis: She attempted to tug the glass door.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that ""She tugged at the glass door,"" which means she actually performed the action of tugging at the door.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that ""She attempted to tug the glass door,"" which implies that she tried to perform the action but does not confirm whether she succeeded or not.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise confirms the action was performed.
   - The Hypothesis suggests an attempt was made but does not confirm the action was completed.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If she tugged at the glass door (Premise), it is definitely true that she attempted to tug the glass door (Hypothesis). The action of tugging inherently includes the attempt to do so.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He tugged at the puppy's ears.,He had a puppy with long ears.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""He tugged at the puppy's ears.""
   - This statement tells us that there is a person (he) who is tugging at the ears of a puppy.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""He had a puppy with long ears.""
   - This statement suggests that the person owns a puppy and that the puppy has long ears.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the length of the puppy's ears. It only mentions that the person is tugging at the puppy's ears.
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information (the puppy has long ears) that is not present in the Premise.
   - The Premise does not confirm or deny the length of the puppy's ears. Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the given Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He tugged at the puppy's ears.,He pushed the puppy's ears.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He tugged at the puppy's ears.""
   - This indicates that the person pulled or yanked the puppy's ears.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""He pushed the puppy's ears.""
   - This indicates that the person applied force to move the puppy's ears in a different manner, specifically pushing rather than pulling.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Tugging and pushing are different actions. Tugging involves pulling, while pushing involves applying force in the opposite direction.
   - Therefore, the actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are not the same and cannot both be true simultaneously.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Thus, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He tugged at the puppy's ears.,The puppy's ears were tugged by him.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

Premise: He tugged at the puppy's ears.
Hypothesis: The puppy's ears were tugged by him.

1. **Identify the main action in the Premise**: The main action is ""He tugged at the puppy's ears.""
2. **Identify the main action in the Hypothesis**: The main action is ""The puppy's ears were tugged by him.""
3. **Compare the actions and subjects**:
   - In the Premise, ""He"" is the subject performing the action of tugging at the puppy's ears.
   - In the Hypothesis, ""The puppy's ears"" are the object being tugged, and ""him"" refers to the subject performing the action.
4. **Check for consistency**:
   - The Hypothesis is a passive rephrasing of the Premise. The action and the entities involved are the same.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis.

Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the same information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.",I tried to break my door down to leave my house.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.""
   - This indicates that the speaker attempted to open the door by kicking it, but the door remained closed.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I tried to break my door down to leave my house.""
   - This suggests that the speaker attempted to break the door to exit the house.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an action (kicking the door) and the result (the door didn't budge).
   - The Hypothesis describes an intention (trying to break the door) and a purpose (to leave the house).

4. **Inference**:
   - The action of kicking the door in the Premise can be seen as an attempt to break it down, which aligns with the Hypothesis.
   - The purpose of leaving the house is not explicitly stated in the Premise, but it is a plausible reason for trying to break the door.

Given that the Hypothesis is a reasonable interpretation of the actions described in the Premise, but the specific intention (to leave the house) is not explicitly mentioned, the relationship is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.",The door swung open immediately from one kick.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.""
Hypothesis: ""The door swung open immediately from one kick.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The speaker kicked the door multiple times.
   - Despite multiple kicks, the door did not move or open.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The door opened immediately after a single kick.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise states that the door did not budge even after multiple kicks.
   - The Hypothesis states that the door opened immediately after just one kick.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise indicates that the door did not open at all, while the Hypothesis claims it opened immediately with one kick.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.",The door didn't budge from my multiple kicks at it.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.""
Hypothesis: ""The door didn't budge from my multiple kicks at it.""

1. **Identify the key information in the Premise:**
   - The speaker kicked at the door a couple of times.
   - The door did not budge as a result of these kicks.

2. **Identify the key information in the Hypothesis:**
   - The door did not budge.
   - The reason it did not budge is due to the speaker's multiple kicks.

3. **Compare the information:**
   - The Hypothesis states that the door did not budge because of the speaker's multiple kicks.
   - The Premise confirms that the speaker kicked the door a couple of times and it did not budge.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is directly supported by the information in the Premise.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or goes beyond what is stated in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

conative,partial,Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.,Henry Edison had gotten a flat on his old automobile.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.""
   - This statement tells us that Henry Edison performed an action involving kicking the tire of an old automobile.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Henry Edison had gotten a flat on his old automobile.""
   - This statement suggests that Henry Edison experienced a flat tire on his old automobile.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the condition of the tire, such as whether it is flat or not. It only mentions the action of kicking the tire.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new piece of information (the flat tire) that is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not confirm or deny the condition of the tire, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the given information.
   - Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Based on this analysis, the appropriate numerical value for the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.,Hendy Edison shined his tire on his new automobile.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.
Hypothesis: Hendy Edison shined his tire on his new automobile.

1. **Subject Comparison**:
   - Premise: Henry Edison
   - Hypothesis: Hendy Edison
   - The names are slightly different, but let's assume they refer to the same person due to a possible typo.

2. **Action Comparison**:
   - Premise: kicked at the tire
   - Hypothesis: shined his tire
   - The actions are different. Kicking a tire and shining a tire are not the same activities.

3. **Object Comparison**:
   - Premise: the tire on the old automobile
   - Hypothesis: his tire on his new automobile
   - The objects are different. The Premise mentions an old automobile, while the Hypothesis mentions a new automobile.

4. **Temporal Aspect**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis do not provide explicit temporal information, but the difference in the state of the automobile (old vs. new) suggests different times or conditions.

Given these points:
- The actions are different.
- The objects (old automobile vs. new automobile) are different.
- The Hypothesis introduces a new condition (new automobile) that is not mentioned in the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise because it describes a different action and a different condition of the automobile.

Therefore, the relation is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.,Henry Edison tried to kick the tire on the old automobile.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.""
   - This statement indicates that Henry Edison performed the action of kicking at the tire on the old automobile.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Henry Edison tried to kick the tire on the old automobile.""
   - This statement suggests that Henry Edison made an attempt to kick the tire on the old automobile, but it does not confirm whether he actually succeeded in kicking it.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that Henry Edison actually kicked at the tire.
   - The Hypothesis states that Henry Edison tried to kick the tire, which implies an attempt but not necessarily a successful action.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If Henry Edison kicked at the tire, it logically follows that he must have tried to kick it first. Therefore, the Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise, nor does it introduce any new information that would make it uncertain.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

conative,partial,Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.,Luke tested the durability of the chair with his shoe.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.""
Hypothesis: ""Luke tested the durability of the chair with his shoe.""

1. **Identify the main action in the Premise:**
   - Luke kicked at the chair leg.
   - He used the toe of his leather half-boot.

2. **Identify the main action in the Hypothesis:**
   - Luke tested the durability of the chair.
   - He used his shoe.

3. **Compare the actions:**
   - Kicking at the chair leg can be interpreted as a way to test its durability, but it is not explicitly stated in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis introduces an additional interpretation (testing durability) that is not directly mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Compare the objects used:**
   - The Premise specifies ""the toe of his leather half-boot.""
   - The Hypothesis generalizes this to ""his shoe,"" which is a reasonable generalization.

5. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is not definitively true based on the Premise alone because the Premise does not explicitly state that Luke was testing the durability of the chair.
   - However, the Hypothesis is plausible and could be true given the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.,Luke pushed the chair away with his tennis shoe.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.""
   - This statement tells us that Luke used his leather half-boot to kick at the leg of a chair.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Luke pushed the chair away with his tennis shoe.""
   - This statement suggests that Luke used a tennis shoe to push the chair away.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise specifies that Luke used a leather half-boot to kick at the chair leg.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that Luke used a tennis shoe to push the chair away.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis involve different types of footwear (leather half-boot vs. tennis shoe).
   - The actions described are also different (kicking vs. pushing).
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true because it contradicts the type of footwear and the action described.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

The numerical value corresponding to Contradiction is **2**.

conative,partial,Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.,The chair leg was kicked at with Luke's toe of his leather half-boot.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.""
   - This sentence describes an action where Luke uses the toe of his leather half-boot to kick at the chair leg.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The chair leg was kicked at with Luke's toe of his leather half-boot.""
   - This sentence describes the same action but from a passive perspective, indicating that the chair leg was the object being kicked at with Luke's toe of his leather half-boot.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: Luke kicking at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.
   - The only difference is the grammatical structure: the Premise is in active voice, and the Hypothesis is in passive voice.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and conveys the same information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

Relation: 0",Relation: 0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He looked down and poked at the keyboard.,He was typing on his computer.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""He looked down and poked at the keyboard.""
   - This statement describes an action where someone is interacting with a keyboard by looking down and poking at it.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""He was typing on his computer.""
   - This statement suggests that the person was engaged in the activity of typing on a computer.

3. **Analysis:**
   - **Entailment (0):** For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise must provide enough information to confirm that the person was indeed typing on a computer. The Premise mentions ""poked at the keyboard,"" which implies some interaction with a keyboard but does not explicitly confirm typing or the presence of a computer.
   - **Neutral (1):** The Premise suggests an interaction with a keyboard, which could be part of typing on a computer, but it does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny that the person was typing. The person could be doing something else with the keyboard (e.g., cleaning it, pressing random keys, etc.).
   - **Contradiction (2):** For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to provide information that directly contradicts the idea of typing on a computer. The Premise does not provide such contradictory information.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relationship is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Premise: He looked down and poked at the keyboard.
Hypothesis: He looked up at his computer screen.

1. **Identify the actions in the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Premise: ""He looked down and poked at the keyboard.""
   - Hypothesis: ""He looked up at his computer screen.""

2. **Compare the actions and directions:**
   - In the Premise, the subject is looking down and interacting with the keyboard.
   - In the Hypothesis, the subject is looking up at the computer screen.

3. **Determine the logical relationship:**
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are in opposite directions (down vs. up).
   - The Premise does not provide any information that would make the Hypothesis necessarily true or false. However, the actions are contradictory in nature because one cannot look down and up simultaneously.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis cannot both be true at the same time, the relationship is a contradiction.

Therefore, the relation is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He looked down and poked at the keyboard.,He looked down and made poking motions in the direction of the keyboard.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: He looked down and poked at the keyboard.
Hypothesis: He looked down and made poking motions in the direction of the keyboard.

1. **Check for Entailment (0)**:
   - The Premise states that ""He looked down and poked at the keyboard.""
   - The Hypothesis states that ""He looked down and made poking motions in the direction of the keyboard.""
   - The action described in the Hypothesis (""made poking motions in the direction of the keyboard"") is essentially a more detailed description of the action described in the Premise (""poked at the keyboard""). The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - Therefore, if he poked at the keyboard, it is reasonable to infer that he made poking motions in the direction of the keyboard.

2. **Check for Contradiction (2)**:
   - There is no information in the Hypothesis that directly contradicts the Premise. Both statements are consistent with each other.

3. **Check for Neutral (1)**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that is uncertain or unrelated to the Premise. It is a restatement of the action described in the Premise in slightly different words.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

1. **Premise:** ""Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.""
   - This statement describes an action where Mary Elizabeth is interacting with the potatoes by poking them.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""Mary Elizabeth was testing the softness of the potatoes.""
   - This statement suggests a reason or purpose behind Mary Elizabeth's action of poking the potatoes, specifically that she was testing their softness.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The Premise does not explicitly state the reason why Mary Elizabeth poked the potatoes. It only describes the action.
   - The Hypothesis provides a possible reason for the action, but this reason is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - Since the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the reason given in the Hypothesis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise.

Therefore, the appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.,Mary Elizabeth stared at the potatoes but made no move towards them.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.""
   - This indicates that Mary Elizabeth actively engaged with the potatoes by jumping up and poking at them.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Mary Elizabeth stared at the potatoes but made no move towards them.""
   - This suggests that Mary Elizabeth did not engage with the potatoes physically; she only stared at them without making any movement towards them.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an active interaction with the potatoes (jumping up and poking).
   - The Hypothesis describes a lack of physical interaction (only staring, no movement).

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise states that Mary Elizabeth poked at the potatoes, while the Hypothesis states that she made no move towards them.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.,The potatoes were poked at as Mary Elizabeth jumped up.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.""
   - This sentence describes two actions performed by Mary Elizabeth: she jumped up and she poked at the potatoes.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The potatoes were poked at as Mary Elizabeth jumped up.""
   - This sentence describes the same two actions but rephrased: the potatoes were poked at while Mary Elizabeth jumped up.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same two actions: jumping up and poking at the potatoes.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the actions but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.
   - The sequence and the actions are consistent between the Premise and the Hypothesis.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.,I had a straw in my cold drink.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.
Hypothesis: I had a straw in my cold drink.

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - The speaker is interacting with ice cubes.
   - The interaction involves poking.
   - The context is a drink.

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker has a straw.
   - The drink is cold.

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - The Premise mentions ice cubes, which implies the drink is cold, aligning with the Hypothesis.
   - The Premise does not mention a straw, so the presence of a straw is not confirmed or denied.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information (the presence of a straw) that is not addressed in the Premise.
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the presence of a straw.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is Neutral.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.,I left the ice cubes in my drink alone.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.""
Hypothesis: ""I left the ice cubes in my drink alone.""

1. **Identify the actions in the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Premise: The action is ""poked at the ice cubes.""
   - Hypothesis: The action is ""left the ice cubes alone.""

2. **Compare the actions:**
   - ""Poked at the ice cubes"" implies an interaction with the ice cubes.
   - ""Left the ice cubes alone"" implies no interaction with the ice cubes.

3. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are directly contradictory. If someone pokes at the ice cubes, they are not leaving them alone.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.,I moved around ice cubes in my drink.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

Premise: ""I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.""
Hypothesis: ""I moved around ice cubes in my drink.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The action described is ""poked at the ice cubes,"" which implies some form of interaction with the ice cubes in the drink.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The action described is ""moved around ice cubes,"" which also implies interaction with the ice cubes in the drink.

3. **Comparing the Actions**: 
   - ""Poked at"" can be considered a specific way of ""moving around"" the ice cubes. When you poke at something, you are likely causing it to move, even if slightly.
   - Therefore, the action of poking at the ice cubes can be seen as a subset of the broader action of moving them around.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since poking at the ice cubes inherently involves moving them around, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the correct relation is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.,Marco had been up very high on a ladder.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.
Hypothesis: Marco had been up very high on a ladder.

1. **Identify the key information in the Premise:**
   - Marco lost his balance.
   - Marco grabbed at the ladder railing.

2. **Identify the key information in the Hypothesis:**
   - Marco had been up very high on a ladder.

3. **Determine if the Hypothesis is definitely true, possibly true, or definitely false given the Premise:**
   - The Premise mentions that Marco grabbed at the ladder railing, which implies he was on a ladder.
   - However, the Premise does not specify how high Marco was on the ladder. He could have been on a low rung or a high rung; the height is not mentioned.

4. **Evaluate the relationship:**
   - Since the Premise does not provide information about the height Marco was at, the Hypothesis (""Marco had been up very high on a ladder"") is not definitely true.
   - The Hypothesis is also not definitely false because it is possible that Marco was up very high on the ladder.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.,Marco maintained balance and didn't need the ladder railing.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.
Hypothesis: Marco maintained balance and didn't need the ladder railing.

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - Marco lost his balance.
   - As a result, he grabbed at the ladder railing.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - Marco maintained his balance.
   - He didn't need to grab the ladder railing.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise states that Marco lost his balance and grabbed the ladder railing.
   - The Hypothesis states the opposite: Marco maintained his balance and didn't need the ladder railing.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If Marco lost his balance and grabbed the ladder railing, it cannot be true that he maintained his balance and didn't need the ladder railing.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.,Marco grabbed at the ladder railing as he lost his balance.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""Marco grabbed at the ladder railing as he lost his balance.""

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:
- The Premise states that Marco lost his balance and then grabbed at the ladder railing.
- The Hypothesis states that Marco grabbed at the ladder railing as he lost his balance.

**Comparison**:
- Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: Marco losing his balance and grabbing at the ladder railing.
- The sequence of actions in both the Premise and the Hypothesis is essentially the same, with the Hypothesis slightly rephrasing the order but not changing the meaning.

**Conclusion**:
- The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because it describes the same event in a slightly different wording.

Therefore, the relationship is **Entailment**.

Relation: 0",Relation: 0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.,I tried to fix the springs in the toy.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.""
   - This statement describes an action where the speaker is applying pressure to springs using their hands.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I tried to fix the springs in the toy.""
   - This statement suggests an intention or attempt to repair or adjust springs that are part of a toy.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not mention anything about a toy or the intention to fix the springs. It only describes the physical action of pushing the springs.
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional context (the springs being part of a toy and the intention to fix them) that is not present in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis must be definitely true given the Premise. This is not the case here because the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm the intention to fix the springs or that they are part of a toy.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. This fits because the Premise does not rule out the possibility that the speaker was trying to fix the springs in a toy, but it also does not confirm it.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. This is not the case because there is no direct contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.,I released the springs with the tips of my fingers.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.""
Hypothesis: ""I released the springs with the tips of my fingers.""

1. **Identify the actions in the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Premise: The action is ""pushed at the springs"" using ""the palms of my hands.""
   - Hypothesis: The action is ""released the springs"" using ""the tips of my fingers.""

2. **Compare the actions:**
   - ""Pushed at the springs"" and ""released the springs"" are different actions. Pushing and releasing are opposite actions in the context of interacting with springs.

3. **Compare the methods:**
   - The Premise mentions using ""the palms of my hands,"" while the Hypothesis mentions using ""the tips of my fingers."" These are different parts of the hands and imply different methods of interaction.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - Since the actions and methods described in the Premise and Hypothesis are different and somewhat opposite (pushing vs. releasing), the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.,I pushed the palms of my hands against the springs.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.""
Hypothesis: ""I pushed the palms of my hands against the springs.""

1. **Identify the main action in the Premise:**
   - The action described is ""pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.""

2. **Identify the main action in the Hypothesis:**
   - The action described is ""pushed the palms of my hands against the springs.""

3. **Compare the actions:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action of pushing the springs using the palms of the hands. The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is essentially the same.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - Since the actions described in both the Premise and the Hypothesis are the same, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is Entailment.

Relation: 0",Relation: 0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.,His belly pushed at the buttons of the hotel elevator through his shirt.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.""
Hypothesis: ""His belly pushed at the buttons of the hotel elevator through his shirt.""

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - ""His belly pushed at the buttons""
   - ""of his white and blue Aloha shirt""

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - ""His belly pushed at the buttons""
   - ""of the hotel elevator""
   - ""through his shirt""

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention ""His belly pushed at the buttons.""
   - The Premise specifies that the buttons are ""of his white and blue Aloha shirt.""
   - The Hypothesis specifies that the buttons are ""of the hotel elevator"" and adds ""through his shirt.""

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Premise and Hypothesis describe different scenarios. The Premise talks about the buttons on his shirt, while the Hypothesis talks about the buttons of a hotel elevator.
   - These two scenarios cannot both be true simultaneously because they refer to different sets of buttons being pushed by his belly.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.,The white and blue Aloha shirt hung on his thin frame.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.""
   - This indicates that the person is likely overweight or has a large belly, causing the shirt to be tight and the buttons to be strained.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The white and blue Aloha shirt hung on his thin frame.""
   - This suggests that the person is thin, and the shirt is loose on him.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a situation where the shirt is tight because of a large belly.
   - The Hypothesis describes a situation where the shirt is loose because of a thin frame.

4. **Inference**:
   - These two descriptions are directly contradictory. The Premise indicates a large belly causing tightness, while the Hypothesis indicates a thin frame causing looseness.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.,The white and blue Aloha shirt buttons stretched over his belly.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.
Hypothesis: The white and blue Aloha shirt buttons stretched over his belly.

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - ""His belly pushed at the buttons""
   - ""white and blue Aloha shirt""

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - ""The white and blue Aloha shirt buttons""
   - ""stretched over his belly""

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention a ""white and blue Aloha shirt.""
   - The Premise states that ""his belly pushed at the buttons,"" which implies that the buttons are under strain due to the belly.
   - The Hypothesis states that the buttons ""stretched over his belly,"" which is a rephrasing of the same idea that the buttons are under strain due to the belly.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a restatement of the Premise using different words. Both convey the same situation: the buttons of the shirt are under strain because of the belly.

Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is:

0 – Entailment

Therefore, the relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He pushed at the doorbell.,He wanted to see if someone was home.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He pushed at the doorbell.""
   - This statement describes an action where someone is pressing or pushing the doorbell.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""He wanted to see if someone was home.""
   - This statement provides a possible reason or motivation for the action described in the premise.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis suggests a motivation for the action in the premise. It is a plausible reason why someone might push a doorbell, but it is not definitively stated in the premise.
   - The premise does not confirm or deny the hypothesis. It simply states the action without providing any context or reasoning behind it.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the hypothesis is a possible explanation but not a certain one given the premise, the relationship is not one of definite truth (entailment) or definite falsehood (contradiction).
   - The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise, which makes the relationship neutral.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He pushed at the doorbell.,He hovered over the doorbell.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: He pushed at the doorbell.
Hypothesis: He hovered over the doorbell.

1. **Identify the actions in the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Premise: ""pushed at the doorbell"" indicates a physical action of pressing the doorbell.
   - Hypothesis: ""hovered over the doorbell"" indicates a different action, where he is near the doorbell but not necessarily pressing it.

2. **Compare the actions:**
   - Pushing the doorbell and hovering over the doorbell are two distinct actions. Pushing implies direct contact and action, while hovering implies being close to but not necessarily making contact.

3. **Determine the relationship:**
   - Since the actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are different and mutually exclusive (one cannot be pushing and hovering at the same time), the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He pushed at the doorbell.,The doorbell was pushed at by him.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""He pushed at the doorbell.""
2. **Hypothesis:** ""The doorbell was pushed at by him.""

- **Step 1: Check for Entailment (0)**
  - The Hypothesis is a passive rephrasing of the Premise. Both statements convey the same action performed by the same subject on the same object.
  - Since the Hypothesis is a direct restatement of the Premise in passive voice, it is definitely true given the Premise.

- **Step 2: Check for Contradiction (2)**
  - There is no information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise. Both statements are consistent with each other.

- **Step 3: Check for Neutral (1)**
  - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that is uncertain or unrelated to the Premise. It is simply a rephrasing.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

**Relation Output: 0**",**Relation Output: 0**,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.",I had a mark on my body I needed to wash off.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.""
   - This indicates that the speaker is using a washcloth to rub at a mark. The location of the mark is not specified.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I had a mark on my body I needed to wash off.""
   - This suggests that the mark is on the speaker's body and they need to wash it off.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not specify where the mark is located. It only mentions that the speaker is rubbing at a mark with a wet washcloth.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that the mark is on the speaker's body and they need to wash it off.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the location of the mark.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is not definitely true (Entailment) nor definitely false (Contradiction) based on the information given in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.",I took a dry washcloth and hovered over the mark.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.""
Hypothesis: ""I took a dry washcloth and hovered over the mark.""

1. **Identify the actions in the Premise:**
   - The speaker took a washcloth.
   - The speaker wet the washcloth.
   - The speaker rubbed at the mark with the wet washcloth.

2. **Identify the actions in the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker took a dry washcloth.
   - The speaker hovered over the mark with the dry washcloth.

3. **Compare the actions:**
   - In the Premise, the washcloth is wet, and the action is rubbing.
   - In the Hypothesis, the washcloth is dry, and the action is hovering.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis (using a dry washcloth and hovering) are different from those in the Premise (using a wet washcloth and rubbing).
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise because it states the washcloth is dry and the action is hovering, which cannot be true if the washcloth is wet and the action is rubbing.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.",I rubbed at the mark with a wet washcloth.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.""
   - This sentence describes a sequence of actions: first, taking a washcloth, then wetting it, and finally rubbing at a mark.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I rubbed at the mark with a wet washcloth.""
   - This sentence describes the action of rubbing at a mark using a wet washcloth.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the final action described in the Premise.
   - The Premise provides additional details about the sequence of actions leading up to the final action, but the core action described in the Hypothesis (""rubbing at the mark with a wet washcloth"") is directly supported by the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because the action of rubbing at the mark with a wet washcloth is explicitly stated in the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

Final Answer:

conative,partial,He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.,He had a fresh bite on his neck.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.""
Hypothesis: ""He had a fresh bite on his neck.""

1. **Identify Key Information in the Premise:**
   - The subject (""He"") is rubbing at a wound.
   - The wound is described as a ""raw bite wound.""
   - The location of the wound is ""on his throat.""

2. **Identify Key Information in the Hypothesis:**
   - The subject (""He"") has a bite.
   - The bite is described as ""fresh.""
   - The location of the bite is ""on his neck.""

3. **Compare the Information:**
   - The Premise mentions a ""raw bite wound,"" which implies that the wound is fresh.
   - The location ""on his throat"" is consistent with ""on his neck,"" as the throat is part of the neck.
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis describe a bite wound in the same general area (neck/throat) and imply that it is recent or fresh.

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the information in the Premise. The description of the wound as ""raw"" in the Premise supports the Hypothesis that it is ""fresh.""
   - The location ""on his throat"" is a specific part of the neck, so there is no contradiction or uncertainty.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final Answer: 0",Final Answer: 0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.,His rubbing came nowhere close to the raw bite wound on his throat.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.""
   - This statement indicates that the subject is actively rubbing a specific area, which is the raw bite wound on his throat.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""His rubbing came nowhere close to the raw bite wound on his throat.""
   - This statement suggests that the subject's rubbing did not come near the raw bite wound on his throat.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the subject is rubbing the raw bite wound on his throat.
   - The Hypothesis states that the subject's rubbing did not come near the raw bite wound on his throat.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the subject is rubbing the raw bite wound on his throat (Premise), it cannot be true that his rubbing came nowhere close to the raw bite wound on his throat (Hypothesis).

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.,His throat had a raw bite wound he rubbed at.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.
Hypothesis: His throat had a raw bite wound he rubbed at.

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - ""He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.""

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - ""His throat had a raw bite wound he rubbed at.""

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention a ""raw bite wound"" on ""his throat.""
   - Both statements indicate that ""he rubbed at"" the wound.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. It conveys the same information using slightly different wording.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis.

Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is:

0 – Entailment

Therefore, the relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I rubbed at the ache in my neck.,I slept on my neck wrong.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I rubbed at the ache in my neck.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker is experiencing some discomfort or pain in their neck and is trying to alleviate it by rubbing.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I slept on my neck wrong.""
   - This statement suggests a possible cause for the neck ache, implying that the discomfort is due to an incorrect sleeping position.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

- **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must definitively imply that the speaker slept on their neck wrong. However, the Premise only mentions the action of rubbing the neck due to an ache, without providing any information about the cause of the ache.
  
- **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it is not necessarily true. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the cause of the neck ache. It is possible that the ache is due to sleeping wrong, but it could also be due to other reasons (e.g., poor posture, injury, etc.).

- **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly conflicts with the idea that the speaker slept on their neck wrong. The Premise does not provide any such conflicting information.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relationship is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I rubbed at the ache in my neck.,I didn't touch my alleviated neck.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""I rubbed at the ache in my neck.""
Hypothesis: ""I didn't touch my alleviated neck.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The speaker is describing an action where they are rubbing their neck because it aches.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The speaker is stating that they did not touch their neck, which is described as alleviated (implying it no longer aches).

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise indicates that the speaker did touch their neck (by rubbing it).
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker did not touch their neck.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise says the neck was touched (rubbed), while the Hypothesis says the neck was not touched.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

conative,partial,I rubbed at the ache in my neck.,I had an ache in my neck I rubbed at.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I rubbed at the ache in my neck.""
Hypothesis: ""I had an ache in my neck I rubbed at.""

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker rubbed at an ache in their neck.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker had an ache in their neck and rubbed at it.

2. **Information Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same information: the presence of an ache in the neck and the action of rubbing it.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrased version of the Premise.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.,Lily was wearing a decorated dress.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.""
   - This statement tells us that Lily is interacting with ribbons that are on her dress.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""Lily was wearing a decorated dress.""
   - This statement suggests that Lily's dress has some form of decoration.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The Premise mentions that there are ribbons on Lily's dress. Ribbons are a form of decoration.
   - Therefore, if Lily's dress has ribbons, it can be inferred that her dress is decorated.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because ribbons are a type of decoration.

Thus, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.,Lily made no attempt to touch the ribbons on her dress.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.""
   - This indicates that Lily is actively engaging with the ribbons on her dress by plucking at them.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Lily made no attempt to touch the ribbons on her dress.""
   - This suggests that Lily did not try to touch the ribbons on her dress at all.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Lily is interacting with the ribbons on her dress.
   - The Hypothesis states that Lily did not interact with the ribbons on her dress.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If Lily is plucking at the ribbons, she is definitely making an attempt to touch them. Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.,There were ribbons on Lily's dress she plucked at.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.
Hypothesis: There were ribbons on Lily's dress she plucked at.

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - Subject: Lily
   - Action: plucked
   - Object: ribbons on her dress

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - Subject: Lily
   - Action: plucked at
   - Object: ribbons on her dress

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - The Hypothesis states that there were ribbons on Lily's dress, which she plucked at.
   - The Premise states that Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise.
   - The information in the Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise.

Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is:

0 – Entailment

Therefore, the relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He stabbed at the last part of the equation.,The last part of the equation was the most complex.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""He stabbed at the last part of the equation.""
   - This suggests that someone is working on an equation and is focusing on the last part of it. The use of ""stabbed"" implies a sense of difficulty or frustration, but it does not provide any specific information about the complexity of the equation.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""The last part of the equation was the most complex.""
   - This statement asserts that the last part of the equation is the most complex part.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not provide any explicit information about the complexity of the last part of the equation. It only indicates that the person is focusing on or struggling with the last part.
   - The Hypothesis makes a specific claim about the complexity of the last part of the equation, which is not directly supported or refuted by the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the complexity of the last part of the equation, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the given Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He stabbed at the last part of the equation.,He drew attention away from the last part of the equation.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""He stabbed at the last part of the equation.""
Hypothesis: ""He drew attention away from the last part of the equation.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The phrase ""He stabbed at the last part of the equation"" suggests that he made an effort or attempted to solve or address the last part of the equation. The word ""stabbed"" is metaphorical here, indicating an attempt or effort.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The phrase ""He drew attention away from the last part of the equation"" suggests that he diverted focus or attention away from the last part of the equation.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise indicates an action directed towards the last part of the equation (an attempt to solve or address it).
   - The Hypothesis indicates an action of diverting attention away from the last part of the equation.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are contradictory. Attempting to address the last part of the equation and drawing attention away from it are mutually exclusive actions.
   - Therefore, if the Premise is true (he attempted to address the last part of the equation), the Hypothesis (he drew attention away from it) cannot be true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He stabbed at the last part of the equation.,He made a stabbing gesture towards the last part of the equation.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""He stabbed at the last part of the equation.""
   - This sentence describes an action where ""he"" is making a stabbing motion towards the last part of an equation.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""He made a stabbing gesture towards the last part of the equation.""
   - This sentence describes ""he"" making a stabbing gesture towards the last part of an equation.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action: making a stabbing motion or gesture towards the last part of an equation.
   - The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is essentially the same.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they describe the same action), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

conative,partial,I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.,I tried to drink the last bits of the slushee with my straw.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.""
   - This indicates that the speaker is interacting with a slushy drink, specifically removing the dome lid and using a straw to stab at the slush.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I tried to drink the last bits of the slushee with my straw.""
   - This suggests that the speaker is attempting to consume the remaining parts of the slushy drink using a straw.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The actions described in the Premise (removing the dome and stabbing at the slush with a straw) are consistent with the actions one might take when trying to drink the last bits of a slushy.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise. Instead, it provides a plausible explanation for why the speaker might be stabbing at the slush with a straw.

4. **Inference**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is a reasonable conclusion. The actions described in the Premise support the idea that the speaker is trying to drink the last bits of the slushy.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

The numerical value corresponding to Entailment is **0**.

conative,partial,I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.,I kept the lid on my drink and slurped the slush with my straw.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.""
Hypothesis: ""I kept the lid on my drink and slurped the slush with my straw.""

1. **Identify Key Actions and States in the Premise:**
   - The plastic dome (lid) was removed from the drink.
   - The action performed was stabbing at the slush with the straw.

2. **Identify Key Actions and States in the Hypothesis:**
   - The plastic dome (lid) was kept on the drink.
   - The action performed was slurping the slush with the straw.

3. **Compare the Actions and States:**
   - The Premise states that the lid was removed, while the Hypothesis states that the lid was kept on. These two statements are directly contradictory.
   - The actions described (stabbing vs. slurping) are also different, but the primary contradiction lies in the state of the lid.

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - Since the Hypothesis states that the lid was kept on, which directly contradicts the Premise where the lid was removed, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

conative,partial,I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.,I stabbed at the slush with the straw after I took the lid off my drink.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.""
Hypothesis: ""I stabbed at the slush with the straw after I took the lid off my drink.""

1. **Identify the actions in the Premise:**
   - Action 1: ""I took the plastic dome from my drink.""
   - Action 2: ""I stabbed at the slush with the straw.""

2. **Identify the actions in the Hypothesis:**
   - Action 1: ""I took the lid off my drink.""
   - Action 2: ""I stabbed at the slush with the straw.""

3. **Compare the actions:**
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the actions in the Premise but maintains the same sequence and meaning.
   - ""Plastic dome"" and ""lid"" are synonymous in this context.
   - The sequence of actions is the same: first, the lid is removed, and then the slush is stabbed with the straw.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis restates the actions described in the Premise in a slightly different wording but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

conative,partial,"She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.","She enjoyed a cup of hot coffee, as it warmed her face and hands.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.""

### Hypothesis:
""She enjoyed a cup of hot coffee, as it warmed her face and hands.""

### Analysis:
1. **Action in Premise**: The woman took a cup, sipped the coffee, closed her eyes, and breathed in the steam.
2. **Action in Hypothesis**: The woman enjoyed a cup of hot coffee, and it warmed her face and hands.

### Key Points:
- **Enjoyment**: The Premise does not explicitly state that she enjoyed the coffee, but closing her eyes and breathing in the steam can imply enjoyment.
- **Temperature**: The Premise mentions steam, which implies the coffee is hot.
- **Warming Effect**: The Premise does not mention the coffee warming her face and hands.

### Conclusion:
- The Hypothesis adds the detail that the coffee warmed her face and hands, which is not mentioned in the Premise.
- The enjoyment aspect is implied but not explicitly stated in the Premise.
- The warming effect is an additional detail that is not necessarily implied by the Premise.

Given these points, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise. There is no direct contradiction, but the additional details are not confirmed by the Premise.

### Final Decision:
The relation is **Neutral**.

conative,partial,"She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.","She took the cold cup and didn't drink it, realizing her coffee was cold.",2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.""
   - This indicates that she took a cup of coffee, sipped it, and enjoyed the steam, suggesting the coffee is hot.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She took the cold cup and didn't drink it, realizing her coffee was cold.""
   - This suggests that she took a cup of coffee, found it cold, and did not drink it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the coffee is hot (she sipped it and enjoyed the steam).
   - The Hypothesis indicates that the coffee is cold (she didn't drink it because it was cold).

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise states the coffee is hot, while the Hypothesis states the coffee is cold.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

conative,partial,"She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.","She took the cup and closed her eyes, as she breathed in the steam of her cup of coffee she was sipping.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

**Premise:** She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.

**Hypothesis:** She took the cup and closed her eyes, as she breathed in the steam of her cup of coffee she was sipping.

1. **Identify the actions and states in the Premise:**
   - She took the cup.
   - She sipped at the coffee.
   - She closed her eyes.
   - She breathed in the steam.

2. **Identify the actions and states in the Hypothesis:**
   - She took the cup.
   - She closed her eyes.
   - She breathed in the steam of her cup of coffee.
   - She was sipping.

3. **Compare the actions and states:**
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis mention that she took the cup.
   - Both mention that she closed her eyes.
   - Both mention that she breathed in the steam.
   - Both mention that she was sipping coffee.

4. **Check for consistency:**
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the actions and states described in the Premise without introducing any new information or contradictions.
   - The sequence of actions in the Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise.

Since the Hypothesis restates the actions and states described in the Premise in a slightly different wording but does not introduce any new information or contradictions, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

**Conclusion:**
The relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

**Relation Output:** 0",**Relation Output:** 0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I sipped at the Heineken.,I had a bottle of beer.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I sipped at the Heineken.""
   - This indicates that the speaker is drinking a Heineken, which is a brand of beer.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I had a bottle of beer.""
   - This suggests that the speaker possesses or has consumed a bottle of beer.

Now, let's evaluate the relationship:

- **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis must be definitely true given the Premise. If the speaker is sipping at a Heineken, it implies that they have a Heineken beer. However, the Hypothesis does not specify the brand, only that it is a bottle of beer. Since Heineken is a type of beer, the Hypothesis can be considered true.
  
- **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Premise did not provide enough information to confirm or deny the Hypothesis. However, in this case, the Premise does provide enough information to confirm that the speaker has a beer.

- **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. This would be the case if the Premise directly contradicted the Hypothesis. Here, there is no contradiction; sipping a Heineken implies having a beer.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis ""I had a bottle of beer"" is definitely true given the Premise ""I sipped at the Heineken.""

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I sipped at the Heineken.,I spit out the Heineken.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I sipped at the Heineken.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker took a sip of the Heineken.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I spit out the Heineken.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker spit out the Heineken after presumably taking it into their mouth.

3. **Analysis**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, it must be definitely true given the Premise. However, the Premise only states that the speaker sipped the Heineken, not that they spit it out.
   - **Neutral (1)**: For the Hypothesis to be neutral, it must be possible but not certain given the Premise. The act of sipping does not necessarily imply spitting out; the speaker could have swallowed the Heineken instead.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, it must be impossible given the Premise. Sipping and spitting out are not mutually exclusive actions; one can sip and then spit out the liquid.

Given that the Hypothesis (""I spit out the Heineken"") is a possible but not certain outcome of the Premise (""I sipped at the Heineken""), the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I sipped at the Heineken.,I had some Heineken.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I sipped at the Heineken.""
Hypothesis: ""I had some Heineken.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The speaker mentions that they sipped at the Heineken. This implies that they drank a small amount of Heineken.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The speaker states that they had some Heineken. This implies that they consumed some quantity of Heineken, without specifying the amount.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The act of sipping at the Heineken (Premise) inherently means that the speaker had some Heineken (Hypothesis), even if it was just a small amount.
   - There is no contradiction between the two statements.
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because sipping at something means having some of it.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.,He toasted together with everyone using glasses of champagne.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

   - This indicates that the person raised a glass and drank champagne in the company of others.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He toasted together with everyone using glasses of champagne.""
   - This suggests that the person participated in a toast with others, using glasses of champagne.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis involve the person raising a glass and drinking champagne with others.
   - The act of toasting typically involves raising a glass and drinking, which aligns with the Premise.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is a reasonable interpretation of the Premise. The act of raising a glass and sipping champagne with others can be seen as participating in a toast.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

conative,partial,He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.,He lowered his glass and didn't sip the champagne with everyone else.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.""
   - This indicates that the person lifted their glass and drank some champagne along with others.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""He lowered his glass and didn't sip the champagne with everyone else.""
   - This suggests that the person did the opposite of what is described in the premise: they lowered their glass and did not drink the champagne with others.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the person raised their glass and sipped champagne.
   - The Hypothesis states that the person lowered their glass and did not sip champagne.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict the actions described in the Premise. If the person raised their glass and sipped champagne, it cannot be true that they lowered their glass and did not sip champagne at the same time.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.,"With everyone else, he tasted the champagne and raised his glass.",0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.
Hypothesis: With everyone else, he tasted the champagne and raised his glass.

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - **Premise**: The actions described are ""raised his glass"" and ""sipped at the champagne"" with the company of others.
   - **Hypothesis**: The actions described are ""tasted the champagne"" and ""raised his glass"" with the company of others.

2. **Action Comparison**:
   - ""Raised his glass"" is present in both the Premise and the Hypothesis.
   - ""Sipped at the champagne"" in the Premise is equivalent to ""tasted the champagne"" in the Hypothesis. Both phrases describe the act of drinking champagne.

3. **Order and Context**:
   - The order of actions in the Hypothesis is reversed compared to the Premise, but the actions themselves are the same.
   - The context of being with ""everyone else"" is consistent in both the Premise and the Hypothesis.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the actions described in the Premise but does not change their meaning.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and does not introduce any contradictory or uncertain elements, the relationship is one of **Entailment**.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

conative,partial,Phil nibbled at the cake.,Phil was too full for cake.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: Phil nibbled at the cake.
Hypothesis: Phil was too full for cake.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise states that Phil nibbled at the cake. This means Phil ate a small amount of the cake.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis states that Phil was too full for cake. This implies that Phil did not want to eat the cake because he was already full.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - If Phil nibbled at the cake, it suggests that he did eat some of it, even if it was just a small amount.
   - The hypothesis claims that Phil was too full to eat the cake, which would imply that he did not eat any of it.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. If Phil nibbled at the cake, he was not too full to eat it.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

   - This means that Phil ate a small amount of the cake.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Phil didn't try the cake.""
   - This means that Phil did not eat any of the cake.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Phil ate a small amount of the cake.
   - The Hypothesis states that Phil did not eat any of the cake.

4. **Inference**:
   - If Phil nibbled at the cake, it directly contradicts the statement that he didn't try the cake. If he nibbled, he must have tried it.

Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

The relationship is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2

Premise: Phil nibbled at the cake.
Hypothesis: Phil ate some cake.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise states that Phil nibbled at the cake. ""Nibbled"" implies that Phil took small bites of the cake.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis states that Phil ate some cake. ""Ate some cake"" implies that Phil consumed a portion of the cake.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - If Phil nibbled at the cake, it means he did eat some part of the cake, even if it was in small amounts.
   - The hypothesis does not specify the quantity of cake eaten, just that some cake was eaten.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis ""Phil ate some cake"" is definitely true given the premise ""Phil nibbled at the cake"" because nibbling involves eating small amounts of the cake.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.",He didn't realize how hungry he was for food.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.
Hypothesis: He didn't realize how hungry he was for food.

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The subject ""He"" initially nibbled at the filet, which suggests a tentative or cautious approach to eating.
   - Subsequently, ""He"" ate ravenously, indicating a sudden and intense hunger.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The subject ""He"" didn't realize how hungry he was for food, implying that his initial nibbling was due to an unawareness of his actual hunger level.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise describes a change in eating behavior from nibbling to eating ravenously, which can be interpreted as a realization of hunger.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that the subject was unaware of his hunger, which aligns with the behavior described in the Premise (starting with nibbling and then eating ravenously).

4. **Determining the Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a plausible explanation for the behavior described in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is not definitively true based on the Premise alone, but it is a reasonable inference.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.","He took big bites of the filet, then slowed down.",2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.""
   - This indicates that the person started by eating small bites (nibbling) and then proceeded to eat with great enthusiasm (ravenously).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He took big bites of the filet, then slowed down.""
   - This suggests that the person started by eating large bites and then reduced the pace of eating.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a progression from small bites to enthusiastic eating.
   - The Hypothesis describes a progression from large bites to slower eating.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis are directly opposite to those in the Premise. The Premise indicates an increase in eating intensity, while the Hypothesis indicates a decrease in eating intensity.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because they describe opposite sequences of eating behavior.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2

Hypothesis: He ate ravenously, after small bites of the filet.

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The subject ""He"" first nibbled at the filet, which means he took small bites.
   - After nibbling, he ate ravenously, indicating he ate with great hunger or enthusiasm.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The subject ""He"" ate ravenously.
   - This action occurred after taking small bites of the filet.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The sequence of actions in the Hypothesis matches the sequence in the Premise.
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis describe the same actions in the same order: small bites followed by ravenous eating.

4. **Determining the Relation:**
   - Since the Hypothesis accurately reflects the sequence and actions described in the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

conative,partial,"He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.","She had worn lipstick that day, not knowing she would be kissed.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.""

### Hypothesis:
""She had worn lipstick that day, not knowing she would be kissed.""

### Analysis:
1. **Content of the Premise:**
   - A man kissed a woman.
   - The man brushed at the lipstick left behind by the woman.

2. **Content of the Hypothesis:**
   - The woman wore lipstick that day.
   - She did not know she would be kissed.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise confirms that the woman had worn lipstick because the man brushed at the lipstick she left behind.
   - The Hypothesis states that she wore lipstick that day, which is consistent with the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis also adds that she did not know she would be kissed, which is additional information not addressed in the Premise. This part of the Hypothesis is not contradicted by the Premise but is also not confirmed by it.

### Conclusion:
- The part of the Hypothesis stating that she wore lipstick is supported by the Premise.
- The part of the Hypothesis stating that she did not know she would be kissed is additional information that is neither confirmed nor denied by the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is **Neutral**.

conative,partial,"He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.",He didn't touch her because of the lipstick she had that would smear on him.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He kissed her in return"" indicates that there was physical contact (a kiss).
   - ""then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind"" suggests that after the kiss, he noticed and tried to remove the lipstick mark she left on him.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He didn't touch her because of the lipstick she had that would smear on him"" suggests that he avoided physical contact with her due to the lipstick.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise clearly states that he did kiss her, which is a form of physical contact.
   - The Hypothesis states that he avoided touching her because of the lipstick.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise indicates that he did touch her (kissed her), while the Hypothesis states that he did not touch her.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

### Premise:
""He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.""

### Hypothesis:
""He wiped at the lipstick he knew she had left behind, after he had kissed her in return.""

### Analysis:
1. **Action Sequence**:
   - **Premise**: The sequence of actions is: he kissed her in return → he brushed at the lipstick.
   - **Hypothesis**: The sequence of actions is: he kissed her in return → he wiped at the lipstick.

2. **Action Description**:
   - **Premise**: Uses the word ""brushed"" to describe the action on the lipstick.
   - **Hypothesis**: Uses the word ""wiped"" to describe the action on the lipstick.

3. **Temporal Order**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis maintain the same temporal order: the action of kissing happens first, followed by the action on the lipstick.

4. **Synonymy**:
   - The words ""brushed"" and ""wiped"" are similar in meaning in this context, both indicating an action to remove or deal with the lipstick.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise with a slight change in wording (""brushed"" to ""wiped"") but maintains the same meaning and sequence of events. Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

### Relation:
0 – Entailment

The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

   - This indicates that a man is observing a woman's face and moving her hair, which is described as ""tumbled over her shoulders.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She had long hair past her shoulders that he moved away.""
   - This suggests that the woman has long hair that extends past her shoulders, and the man is moving it away.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes the hair as ""tumbled over her shoulders,"" which implies that the hair is long enough to fall over her shoulders.
   - The Hypothesis states that the hair is ""long hair past her shoulders,"" which is consistent with the description in the Premise.
   - The action of moving the hair away is also consistent between the Premise and the Hypothesis.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because the descriptions of the hair and the action of moving it are consistent and directly supported by the information in the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.""
   - This sentence describes two actions: studying her face and brushing at her hair.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""As he studied her face, he made a brushing movement at the hair tumbling over her shoulders.""
   - This sentence describes the same two actions but adds a temporal conjunction ""As"" to indicate that the brushing movement happened while he was studying her face.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same two actions: studying her face and brushing at her hair.
   - The Hypothesis adds a temporal relationship between the two actions, but it does not change the meaning of the actions described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because it describes the same actions with an added temporal conjunction that does not contradict or introduce uncertainty.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

conative,partial,Someone hammered at the front door.,Someone was trying to get in the house.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: Someone hammered at the front door.
Hypothesis: Someone was trying to get in the house.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The statement ""Someone hammered at the front door"" suggests that there was a loud knocking or banging at the front door. This action could be interpreted in various ways, such as someone trying to get attention, someone in distress, or someone trying to enter the house.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The statement ""Someone was trying to get in the house"" implies that the person at the front door had the intention of entering the house.

3. **Evaluating the Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the action of hammering at the front door must unequivocally indicate an attempt to enter the house. However, hammering at the door could have other intentions (e.g., seeking attention, delivering a message, etc.).
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. Hammering at the door could be an attempt to get in, but it is not the only possible reason for such an action. Therefore, the Hypothesis is plausible but not certain.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise explicitly indicated that the person was not trying to get in the house. However, the Premise does not provide such a contradiction.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Someone hammered at the front door.,Someone didn't touch the front door.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Someone hammered at the front door.""
   - This statement indicates that an action (hammering) was performed on the front door by someone.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Someone didn't touch the front door.""
   - This statement indicates that no one touched the front door.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that someone hammered at the front door, which implies that the front door was indeed touched.
   - The Hypothesis states that no one touched the front door, which directly contradicts the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

The numerical value corresponding to Contradiction is **2**.

**Final Answer**: 2",**Final Answer**: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Someone hammered at the front door.,The front door was hammered by someone.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: Someone hammered at the front door.
Hypothesis: The front door was hammered by someone.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The statement ""Someone hammered at the front door"" indicates that an individual performed the action of hammering at the front door.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The statement ""The front door was hammered by someone"" is a passive construction of the same action described in the Premise. It indicates that the front door received the action of being hammered by an individual.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**: Both statements describe the same event, just in different grammatical structures (active vs. passive voice). The content and meaning remain unchanged.

4. **Determining the Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. Since both statements describe the same event, the Hypothesis is definitely true if the Premise is true.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. This is not applicable here because the Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise. This is not applicable here because there is no contradiction between the statements.

intransitive-motion,schematic,The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.,There is a river called the Weantic River.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.
Hypothesis: There is a river called the Weantic River.

1. **Check for Entailment (0):**
   - The Premise states that ""The Weweantic River flows through the pond.""
   - For the Hypothesis to be entailed, it must be definitely true given the Premise.
   - The Premise mentions ""The Weweantic River,"" which implies the existence of a river called ""The Weweantic River.""
   - The Hypothesis states, ""There is a river called the Weantic River.""
   - The only difference is the spelling: ""Weweantic"" vs. ""Weantic.""

2. **Check for Contradiction (2):**
   - For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, it must be impossible given the Premise.
   - The Premise does not provide any information that directly contradicts the existence of a river called ""The Weantic River.""

3. **Check for Neutral (1):**
   - For the Hypothesis to be neutral, it must be a statement that may or may not be true given the Premise.
   - The Premise does not confirm or deny the existence of a river called ""The Weantic River"" specifically, but it does confirm the existence of a river called ""The Weweantic River.""
   - The slight difference in spelling suggests that the Hypothesis may or may not be referring to the same river, making it ambiguous.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis is not definitely true (Entailment) nor definitely false (Contradiction) based on the Premise. The slight difference in spelling makes it ambiguous, leading to a Neutral relation.

Premise: The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.
Hypothesis: The Weweantic River does not flow through the pond.

1. **Identify the key information in the Premise:**
   - The Weweantic River flows through the pond.

2. **Identify the key information in the Hypothesis:**
   - The Weweantic River does not flow through the pond.

3. **Compare the information:**
   - The Premise states that the Weweantic River flows through the pond.
   - The Hypothesis states that the Weweantic River does not flow through the pond.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise. If the Premise is true, the Hypothesis cannot be true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

   - This statement indicates that the Weweantic River has a flow that passes through a pond.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Water from the Weweantic River moves through the pond.""
   - This statement suggests that water originating from the Weweantic River is moving through the pond.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the river flows through the pond.
   - The Hypothesis states that water from the river moves through the pond.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the river flows through the pond, it is logical to infer that water from the river is moving through the pond. The flow of a river inherently involves the movement of water.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

     - Location: Cambodia, capital Phnom Penh
     - Action: Several hundred people marched
     - Purpose: Appeal for an end to growing drug use

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital to appeal for an end to prescription drug abuse.""
   - Key points:
     - Location: Cambodia, capital (Phnom Penh is implied but not explicitly mentioned)
     - Action: Several hundred people marched
     - Purpose: Appeal for an end to prescription drug abuse

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the same location (Cambodia, capital city).
   - Both mention the same action (several hundred people marched).
   - The difference lies in the purpose:
     - Premise: Appeal for an end to growing drug use (general drug use).
     - Hypothesis: Appeal for an end to prescription drug abuse (specific type of drug use).

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis specifies a particular type of drug abuse (prescription drug abuse), which is a subset of the broader category mentioned in the Premise (growing drug use).
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise because the Premise does not specify the type of drug use. It could include prescription drug abuse, but it is not explicitly stated.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

   - Key points:
     - Location: Cambodia, capital Phnom Penh.
     - Action: Few people walked.
     - Purpose: To deny an end to growing drug use.

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Number of People**: The Premise mentions ""several hundred people,"" while the Hypothesis mentions ""few people."" This is a significant difference in the number of participants.
   - **Action**: The Premise uses ""marched,"" which implies a more organized and purposeful movement, while the Hypothesis uses ""walked,"" which is less specific and less organized.
   - **Purpose**: The Premise states the purpose as ""to appeal for an end to growing drug use,"" while the Hypothesis states the purpose as ""to deny an end to growing drug use."" These purposes are directly contradictory.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise because the number of people, the nature of the action, and the purpose are all in direct contradiction.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

   - Both mention the purpose of the march: ""to appeal for an end to growing drug use.""
   - Both specify the location: ""through the capital Phnom Penh"" and ""in Cambodia.""

2. **Paraphrasing Check:**
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a paraphrased version of the Premise. The order of phrases is slightly different, but the meaning remains the same.

3. **Consistency Check:**
   - There are no additional details in the Hypothesis that are not present in the Premise.
   - There are no contradictions or neutral statements; the Hypothesis directly follows from the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and retains the same meaning, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker vividly remembers falling down the first flight of stairs in their house onto the landing in front of the main door.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The speaker had great memory of events, but not great balance since they fell down the stairs like that.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise confirms that the speaker has a vivid memory of a specific event (falling down the stairs).
   - The Hypothesis makes two claims:
     1. The speaker has a great memory of events.
     2. The speaker does not have great balance, inferred from the fact that they fell down the stairs.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The first part of the Hypothesis (great memory of events) is supported by the Premise, as the speaker vividly remembers the event.
   - The second part of the Hypothesis (not great balance) is an inference based on the event described in the Premise. However, the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the speaker generally has poor balance; it only describes a single incident of falling.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. The Premise supports the memory aspect but does not provide conclusive evidence about the speaker's overall balance.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise**: ""In VERY vivid detail I remember FALLING down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door.""
   - The speaker clearly states that they remember falling down the stairs in vivid detail.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I don't remember at all falling down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door.""
   - The speaker claims that they do not remember falling down the stairs at all.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker remembers the event in vivid detail.
   - The Hypothesis states the exact opposite, that the speaker does not remember the event at all.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the speaker remembers the event vividly, it cannot be true that they do not remember it at all.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

1. **Content Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker remembers falling down the first flight of stairs in their house onto the landing in front of the main door in very vivid detail.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker fell down the first flight of stairs in their house onto the landing in front of the main door and remembers it all in very vivid detail.

2. **Information Check**:
   - The Hypothesis contains all the information present in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but maintains the same meaning.

   - The Hypothesis adds the detail that the person driving the car was innocent.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Premise does not provide information about the innocence or guilt of the person driving the car.
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information (the innocence of the driver) that is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.

Since the Hypothesis introduces new information that is not addressed in the Premise, it is possible but not certain based on the given information.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,"People who SPILLED over from the ""protest"" attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.","People who spilled over from the ""protest"" quietly watched their car as it went down Regent Street. (AMR)",2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""People who SPILLED over from the 'protest' attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.""
   - This statement describes a scenario where people from a protest attacked a car.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""People who spilled over from the 'protest' quietly watched their car as it went down Regent Street.""
   - This statement describes a scenario where people from a protest quietly watched a car.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The key action in the Premise is ""attacked their car.""
   - The key action in the Hypothesis is ""quietly watched their car.""

4. **Inference Analysis**:
   - The action ""attacked"" in the Premise is directly contradictory to ""quietly watched"" in the Hypothesis. If people are attacking a car, they cannot be quietly watching it at the same time.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"People who SPILLED over from the ""protest"" attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.","Their car was attacked by people who spilled over from the ""protest"" as it went down Regent Street.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: People who SPILLED over from the ""protest"" attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.
Hypothesis: Their car was attacked by people who spilled over from the ""protest"" as it went down Regent Street.

1. **Content Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention ""people who spilled over from the 'protest'"".
   - Both state that these people ""attacked their car"".
   - Both specify that this event occurred ""as it went down Regent Street"".

2. **Paraphrasing**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. It does not introduce any new information or contradict the information given in the Premise.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise. If the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must also be true.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.",Marchers will proceed on Market until they reach the capital building.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.""
   - This indicates a specific route that the marchers will take: starting on Pine St., then moving to Broadway, and finally to Market.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Marchers will proceed on Market until they reach the capital building.""
   - This suggests that the marchers will continue on Market Street until they reach a specific destination, the capital building.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not mention anything about the marchers' final destination or how long they will proceed on Market Street.
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information about the marchers' destination (the capital building) and implies that they will continue on Market Street until they reach it.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the final destination or the duration of the march on Market Street.
   - Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Based on this analysis, the appropriate numerical value is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.",Marchers will stop at Pine St and not continue to Broadway nor Market.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.""
   - This indicates that the marchers will continue their route from Pine St. to Broadway and then to Market.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Marchers will stop at Pine St and not continue to Broadway nor Market.""
   - This suggests that the marchers will halt their progress at Pine St. and will not proceed to Broadway or Market.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the marchers will continue their route beyond Pine St. to Broadway and Market.
   - The Hypothesis states the opposite, that the marchers will stop at Pine St. and not continue further.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise. According to the Premise, the marchers will proceed beyond Pine St., while the Hypothesis claims they will stop at Pine St.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.","From Pine St., to Broadway, then to Market marchers will continue.",0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that marchers will proceed on Pine St. to Broadway, and then to Market.
   - This indicates a specific route: starting from Pine St., moving to Broadway, and then proceeding to Market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that from Pine St., to Broadway, then to Market, marchers will continue.
   - This essentially rephrases the route described in the Premise: starting from Pine St., moving to Broadway, and then proceeding to Market.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of streets: Pine St. to Broadway to Market.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise. It simply rephrases the route described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (it is a rephrasing of the same information), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

   - ""Mine workers and supporters are protesting for fair wages at the Peabody Energy in St. Louis on this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.""
   - Key points:
     - Mine workers and supporters.
     - Protesting for fair wages.
     - Location: Peabody Energy in St. Louis.
     - Date: this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis mention ""mine workers and supporters"" and the location ""Peabody Energy in St. Louis"" on the same date ""this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.""
   - The Premise states that they plan to ""march,"" while the Hypothesis states that they are ""protesting for fair wages.""

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The act of marching can be associated with a form of protest, but the Premise does not explicitly state the reason for the march.
   - The Hypothesis adds the specific reason ""protesting for fair wages,"" which is not mentioned in the Premise.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis introduces additional information that is not confirmed by the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Thus, the relationship is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,"He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet , when a coil of gold , the color of the moonlight , FLASHED across the sand .","The man had vistied a totally different planet covered in sand that had looked like the wrong one, when a light flashed across the sand.",1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

### Premise:
""He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, FLASHED across the sand.""

### Hypothesis:
""The man had visited a totally different planet covered in sand that had looked like the wrong one, when a light flashed across the sand.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Subject Identification:**
   - **Premise:** ""He"" (a man) is the subject.
   - **Hypothesis:** ""The man"" is the subject.

2. **Context and Setting:**
   - **Premise:** The man is on a planet and is afraid it might be the wrong one. A coil of gold, resembling moonlight, flashes across the sand.
   - **Hypothesis:** The man had visited a different planet covered in sand that looked like the wrong one, and a light flashed across the sand.

3. **Key Events:**
   - **Premise:** The man is currently on a planet and sees a coil of gold flash across the sand.
   - **Hypothesis:** The man had visited a different planet (implying a past event) and saw a light flash across the sand.

4. **Temporal Aspect:**
   - **Premise:** The event is happening in the present.
   - **Hypothesis:** The event is described as having happened in the past.

5. **Details and Specificity:**
   - **Premise:** The description is specific about the coil of gold and its color.
   - **Hypothesis:** The description is more general, mentioning a light flashing across the sand without specifying the coil of gold or its color.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis introduces the idea of a past visit to a different planet, which is not mentioned in the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the past visit to a different planet. Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

### Relation:
1 – Neutral

The Hypothesis introduces additional context that is not directly supported or contradicted by the Premise. Thus, the relationship is Neutral.

**Final Answer:**
1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,"He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet , when a coil of gold , the color of the moonlight , FLASHED across the sand .","He was not afraid that he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand.",2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, FLASHED across the sand.""

Hypothesis: ""He was not afraid that he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand.""

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - The subject ""He"" is beginning to be afraid.
   - The reason for the fear is that he might have come to the wrong planet.
   - A coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand.

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - The subject ""He"" is not afraid.
   - The context is the same: a coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand.

3. **Compare the key elements:**
   - The Premise states that ""He was beginning to be afraid.""
   - The Hypothesis states that ""He was not afraid.""

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Premise and Hypothesis directly contradict each other regarding the subject's emotional state (afraid vs. not afraid).

Given this direct contradiction, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet , when a coil of gold , the color of the moonlight , FLASHED across the sand .","A coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand as he was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, FLASHED across the sand.""

### Hypothesis:
""A coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand as he was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet.""

### Analysis:
1. **Content Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same events: a person beginning to be afraid they had come to the wrong planet, and a coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashing across the sand.
   
2. **Order of Events**:
   - The Premise states the sequence of events in one order: fear followed by the flash of gold.
   - The Hypothesis states the same events but in a slightly different order: the flash of gold followed by the fear.
   
3. **Meaning and Implication**:
   - Despite the difference in the order of events, the meaning conveyed by both the Premise and the Hypothesis is essentially the same. The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise, maintaining the same meaning and context.

### Conclusion:
Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise with no additional or contradictory information, it can be concluded that the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

### Relation:

intransitive-motion,schematic,I RAN around the track.,I run professionally.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""I RAN around the track.""
Hypothesis: ""I run professionally.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that the speaker ran around the track. This is a specific instance of running.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis suggests that the speaker runs professionally, implying that running is a regular activity and possibly a career or serious pursuit.

3. **Checking for Entailment**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide sufficient information to conclude that the speaker runs professionally. However, the Premise only indicates a single instance of running and does not provide any information about the frequency, context, or professional nature of the running.

4. **Checking for Contradiction**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that directly opposes the idea of running professionally. The Premise does not provide any such information; it simply states that the speaker ran around the track.

5. **Checking for Neutrality**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to determine whether the speaker runs professionally or not. It is possible that the speaker runs professionally, but it is also possible that the speaker does not.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is Neutral.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,I RAN around the track.,I walked around the track.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I RAN around the track.""
   - This statement indicates that the person performed the action of running around the track.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I walked around the track.""
   - This statement indicates that the person performed the action of walking around the track.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Running and walking are two different actions. Running generally implies a faster pace than walking.
   - If someone ran around the track, it implies they did not walk around the track, as running and walking are mutually exclusive in this context.

4. **Inference**:
   - Given that the Premise states the person ran, it contradicts the Hypothesis that the person walked.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,I RAN around the track.,I circled the track by running.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I RAN around the track.""
Hypothesis: ""I circled the track by running.""

1. **Check for Entailment (0):**
   - The Premise states that the person ran around the track.
   - The Hypothesis states that the person circled the track by running.
   - ""Running around the track"" and ""circling the track by running"" are essentially describing the same action. The act of running around the track implies making a circular or looped path around it.

2. **Check for Neutral (1):**
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that is not already implied by the Premise. The Hypothesis does not introduce any new elements that could make it uncertain or neutral.

3. **Check for Contradiction (2):**
   - There is no contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis. Both statements are consistent with each other.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DROVE through the tunnel.,I was driving in my car,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""I DROVE through the tunnel.""
Hypothesis: ""I was driving in my car.""

1. **Check for Entailment (0):**
   - The Premise states that the speaker drove through a tunnel.
   - Driving through a tunnel typically implies that the person was in a vehicle, most likely a car.
   - Therefore, if someone drove through a tunnel, it is reasonable to infer that they were driving a car.

2. **Check for Neutral (1):**
   - The Hypothesis ""I was driving in my car"" is a plausible scenario given the Premise.
   - However, it is also possible that the person could have been driving another type of vehicle (e.g., a motorcycle, a truck, etc.).
   - But since the most common interpretation of ""drove"" involves a car, the Hypothesis is strongly supported by the Premise.

3. **Check for Contradiction (2):**
   - There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the Hypothesis.
   - The Premise does not provide any details that would make the Hypothesis impossible.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis is strongly supported by the Premise and is the most likely scenario. Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DROVE through the tunnel.,I avoided the tunnel.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I DROVE through the tunnel.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker has driven through the tunnel.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I avoided the tunnel.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker did not go through the tunnel.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker drove through the tunnel.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker avoided the tunnel.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the speaker drove through the tunnel, it is impossible for them to have avoided the tunnel at the same time.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DROVE through the tunnel.,I went throught the tunnel by driving.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""I DROVE through the tunnel.""
Hypothesis: ""I went through the tunnel by driving.""

1. **Check for Entailment (0):**
   - The Premise states that the person drove through the tunnel.
   - The Hypothesis states that the person went through the tunnel by driving.
   - Both statements convey the same action and method of traversal (driving through the tunnel).
   - Therefore, if the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must also be true.

2. **Check for Neutral (1):**
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that is not already present in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any uncertainty or additional context that would make it possibly true or false.

3. **Check for Contradiction (2):**
   - There is no contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis. Both statements are consistent with each other.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Relation: 0",Relation: 0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,We DROVE past the hotel.,We DROVE all the way to the next city.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: We DROVE past the hotel.
Hypothesis: We DROVE all the way to the next city.

1. **Check for Entailment (0)**:
   - For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, it must be definitely true given the Premise.
   - The Premise states that ""We DROVE past the hotel,"" but it does not provide any information about driving to the next city.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is not definitely true based on the Premise alone.

2. **Check for Contradiction (2)**:
   - For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, it must be impossible given the Premise.
   - The Premise does not state anything that would make driving to the next city impossible. It only mentions driving past the hotel.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is not impossible based on the Premise.

3. **Check for Neutral (1)**:
   - For the Hypothesis to be neutral, it must be a statement that may or may not be true given the Premise.
   - The Premise mentions driving past the hotel, which does not provide enough information to determine whether they drove to the next city or not.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,We DROVE past the hotel.,We drove straight to the hotel.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: We DROVE past the hotel.
Hypothesis: We drove straight to the hotel.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The statement ""We DROVE past the hotel"" indicates that the action of driving involved passing by the hotel without stopping or going directly to it.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The statement ""We drove straight to the hotel"" suggests that the driving was directed towards the hotel as the destination, implying that they arrived at the hotel.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise indicates that the hotel was not the final destination or that they did not stop at the hotel.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that the hotel was the final destination and they drove directly to it.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If they drove past the hotel, it contradicts the idea that they drove straight to the hotel as their destination.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,We DROVE past the hotel.,We were driving when we went past the hotel.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""We DROVE past the hotel.""
   - This indicates that the action of driving past the hotel has already occurred.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""We were driving when we went past the hotel.""
   - This suggests that the action of driving was happening at the time they went past the hotel.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that they drove past the hotel, which implies that they were indeed driving at that time.
   - The Hypothesis states that they were driving when they went past the hotel, which is consistent with the information given in the Premise.

Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is:

0 – Entailment

Therefore, the relation is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.,The plane flew to its destination of California.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.""
   - This statement tells us that the plane was in flight and passed over the Grand Canyon.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The plane flew to its destination of California.""
   - This statement suggests that the plane's final destination was California.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the plane's final destination. It only mentions that the plane flew over the Grand Canyon.
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information about the plane's destination (California) which is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not confirm or deny the destination of the plane, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the given information.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.,The plane didn't pass over the Grand Canyon.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.
Hypothesis: The plane didn't pass over the Grand Canyon.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The statement indicates that the plane flew over the Grand Canyon. This means the plane was in the air and traveled above the Grand Canyon.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The statement indicates that the plane did not pass over the Grand Canyon. This means the plane did not travel above the Grand Canyon.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise states that the plane flew over the Grand Canyon.
   - The Hypothesis states that the plane did not pass over the Grand Canyon.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the plane flew over the Grand Canyon, it must have passed over it.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.,The plane was flying when it went over the Grand Canyon.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.
Hypothesis: The plane was flying when it went over the Grand Canyon.

1. **Check for Entailment (0)**:
   - The Premise states that the plane ""FLEW"" over the Grand Canyon.
   - The Hypothesis states that the plane ""was flying"" when it went over the Grand Canyon.
   - Both statements describe the same event: the plane being in flight over the Grand Canyon.
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise, indicating the same action (flying) and location (over the Grand Canyon).

2. **Check for Contradiction (2)**:
   - There is no information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise. Both statements are consistent with each other.

3. **Check for Neutral (1)**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that is uncertain or unrelated to the Premise. It simply restates the action described in the Premise.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. Therefore, the relation is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .,I pass by Watkins Landing on my way into work and back home.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
Hypothesis: ""I pass by Watkins Landing on my way into work and back home.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The speaker drives past Watkins Landing twice a day: once in the morning and once in the evening.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The speaker passes by Watkins Landing on their way to work and on their way back home.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker drives past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that these drives occur on the way to work in the morning and on the way back home in the evening.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Hypothesis is a plausible explanation for the Premise. If someone drives past a location every morning and evening, it is reasonable to infer that this could be on their way to work and back home.
   - However, the Premise does not explicitly state the purpose of the drives (i.e., going to work and returning home). Therefore, while the Hypothesis is a reasonable interpretation, it is not definitively confirmed by the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .,I avoid going past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
Hypothesis: ""I avoid going past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""

1. **Identify the main action in the Premise:**
   - The main action is ""I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""

2. **Identify the main action in the Hypothesis:**
   - The main action is ""I avoid going past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""

3. **Compare the actions:**
   - The Premise states that the person drives past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
   - The Hypothesis states that the person avoids going past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are directly contradictory. If someone drives past a location, they are not avoiding it. Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .,My driving route goes past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker drives past a specific location, Watkins Landing, twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""My driving route goes past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker's driving route includes passing by Watkins Landing twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action: driving past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise and does not add or contradict any information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail .,I commute by bike to stay healthy and enjoy the views from the Huguenot Trail.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail.""
Hypothesis: ""I commute by bike to stay healthy and enjoy the views from the Huguenot Trail.""

1. **Identify the main information in the Premise:**
   - The speaker commutes back and forth to work.
   - The commuting route is the Huguenot Trail.

2. **Identify the main information in the Hypothesis:**
   - The speaker commutes by bike.
   - The purpose of commuting by bike is to stay healthy and enjoy the views from the Huguenot Trail.

3. **Compare the information:**
   - The Premise does not specify the mode of commuting (e.g., bike, car, walking).
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional details about the mode of commuting (by bike) and the reasons for it (to stay healthy and enjoy the views).

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the mode of commuting or the reasons for it.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is not definitely true (Entailment) nor definitely false (Contradiction) based on the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail .,I go around the Hugenot Trail as I go back and forth to work.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail.""
   - This means the person travels to and from work using the Huguenot Trail.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I go around the Huguenot Trail as I go back and forth to work.""
   - This suggests the person avoids or bypasses the Huguenot Trail while commuting to and from work.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the person uses the Huguenot Trail for commuting.
   - The Hypothesis states that the person avoids the Huguenot Trail for commuting.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the person uses the Huguenot Trail for commuting (Premise), it is impossible for them to simultaneously avoid it (Hypothesis).

Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

The relation is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail .,I take the Hugenot Trail back and forth to work.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""I COMMUTE back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail.""
Hypothesis: ""I take the Hugenot Trail back and forth to work.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The speaker commutes back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail. This means that the Huguenot Trail is the route used for commuting to and from work.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The speaker takes the Hugenot Trail back and forth to work. This implies that the Hugenot Trail is the route used for traveling to and from work.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - Both statements indicate that the Huguenot Trail is used for commuting to and from work.
   - The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is essentially the same.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because both statements convey the same information about the route used for commuting.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

### Hypothesis:
""Dade County and federal authorities, who are famous for daring arrests, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.""

### Analysis:
1. **Common Information**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis state that Dade County and federal authorities made plans to arrest him on gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.
   - Both mention that the authorities learned he intended to fly through Miami.

2. **Additional Information in Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis adds the detail that Dade County and federal authorities are ""famous for daring arrests.""

3. **Evaluation**:
   - The additional detail in the Hypothesis (""famous for daring arrests"") does not contradict any information in the Premise.
   - The additional detail is not necessarily implied by the Premise, but it does not make the Hypothesis false or contradictory.
   - The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm the fame of the authorities for daring arrests.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is Neutral.

### Premise:
""Dade County and federal authorities, learning that he intended to FLY through Miami, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.""

### Hypothesis:
""Dade County and federal authorities, didn't know that he intended to FLY through Miami, so they didn't make plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.""

### Analysis:
1. **Premise** states that the authorities learned about his intention to fly through Miami and made plans to arrest him.
2. **Hypothesis** states the opposite: the authorities didn't know about his intention to fly through Miami and therefore didn't make plans to arrest him.

### Conclusion:
- The Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise.
- According to the Premise, the authorities were aware and made plans, while the Hypothesis claims they were unaware and did not make plans.

Given this direct contradiction, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

**Relation: 2**",**Relation: 2**,False,False,True,2

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - **Entities Involved**: Dade County and federal authorities, an unnamed individual.
   - **Actions**: Authorities learned about the individual's intention to fly through Miami and made plans to arrest him on gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - **Entities Involved**: Dade County and federal authorities, an unnamed individual.
   - **Actions**: Authorities made plans to arrest the individual on gun-running charges as soon as he touched U.S. soil once they learned he intended to fly into Miami.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the same entities: Dade County and federal authorities, and the individual.
   - Both state that the authorities learned about the individual's intention to fly through/into Miami.
   - Both indicate that the authorities made plans to arrest the individual on gun-running charges as soon as he hit/touched U.S. soil.

4. **Paraphrasing**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a paraphrase of the Premise. The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is the same.

5. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

**Relation: 0**",**Relation: 0**,True,False,False,0

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Oguz mentioned that anyone flying over major opium-producing areas would see a lot of small fires in the mountains.
   - These small fires are identified as heroin labs.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that major opium-producing areas that house heroin labs can be spotted by looking for small fires from high above.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise provides specific information that flying over major opium-producing areas reveals small fires, which are heroin labs.
   - The hypothesis generalizes this information by stating that these areas can be spotted by looking for small fires from high above.

4. **Inference**:
   - The hypothesis is a logical conclusion derived from the premise. If anyone flying over these areas can see small fires, and these fires are heroin labs, then it follows that these areas can be identified by looking for small fires from above.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

### Premise:
""Oguz said that anyone FLYING over the major opium producing areas would see a lot of small fires in the mountains, which are heroin labs.""

### Hypothesis:
""Anyone would be able to see a lot of small fires in the mountains, which are heroin labs, if you are flying over major opium producing areas said Oguz.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Content Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention ""flying over the major opium producing areas.""
   - Both state that ""anyone would see a lot of small fires in the mountains, which are heroin labs.""
   - Both attribute this information to Oguz.

2. **Paraphrasing**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a paraphrased version of the Premise. It rearranges the sentence structure but retains the same meaning.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis.
   - The Hypothesis does not imply anything that is not already stated in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise with no additional or contradictory information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

**Premise:** Each year, over 50,000 migratory birds FLY over Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here.

**Hypothesis:** Each year, over 50,000 migratory birds FLY over Hong Kong's skyscrapers and have inspired beautiful art for generations.

1. **Compare the main events:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers each year.
   
2. **Additional information:**
   - The Premise states that these birds choose to roost for winter in Hong Kong.
   - The Hypothesis states that these birds have inspired beautiful art for generations.

3. **Check for consistency:**
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information (inspiring beautiful art) that is not mentioned in the Premise.
   - However, this new information does not contradict the Premise. It is possible that the birds could inspire art while also roosting for winter.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - Since the Hypothesis introduces new information that is not necessarily implied by the Premise but does not contradict it, the relationship is Neutral.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1

### Premise:
""Each year, over 50,000 migratory birds FLY over Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here.""

### Hypothesis:
""Each year, over 50,000 migratory birds go around Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose to not roost for winter here.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Action of Birds:**
   - **Premise:** The birds ""FLY over"" Hong Kong's skyscrapers.
   - **Hypothesis:** The birds ""go around"" Hong Kong's skyscrapers.
   - **Analysis:** The actions described are different. ""Fly over"" and ""go around"" are not the same.

2. **Roosting Behavior:**
   - **Premise:** The birds ""choose to roost for winter here.""
   - **Hypothesis:** The birds ""choose to not roost for winter here.""
   - **Analysis:** The roosting behavior is directly contradictory. The Premise states that the birds roost, while the Hypothesis states that they do not roost.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise in both the action of the birds and their roosting behavior. Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

**Premise:** Each year, over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here.

**Hypothesis:** Over 50,000 migratory birds choose to roost for winter each year as they fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers.

1. **Content Comparison:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention ""over 50,000 migratory birds.""
   - Both state that these birds ""fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers.""
   - Both indicate that these birds ""choose to roost for winter"" in Hong Kong.
   - Both specify that this event happens ""each year.""

2. **Order and Causality:**
   - The Premise states the sequence: birds fly over skyscrapers and then choose to roost.
   - The Hypothesis states the sequence: birds choose to roost as they fly over skyscrapers.
   - The slight difference in phrasing does not change the overall meaning or factual content.

3. **Logical Consistency:**
   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise. The slight rephrasing does not introduce any new information or contradictions.

Given that the Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

intransitive-motion,schematic,But it's all FLYING right over your head.,They are not understanding the point.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""But it's all FLYING right over your head.""
Hypothesis: ""They are not understanding the point.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The phrase ""it's all FLYING right over your head"" is an idiomatic expression that means someone is not understanding or comprehending something.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis states ""They are not understanding the point,"" which directly means that the individuals in question are not comprehending the point being made.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**: 
   - The idiom in the premise (""it's all FLYING right over your head"") and the statement in the hypothesis (""They are not understanding the point"") convey the same meaning.
   - Both indicate a lack of understanding.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - Since the hypothesis is a direct restatement of the meaning of the premise, it is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment

The final output is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,But it's all FLYING right over your head.,But it's all sticking in your head.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""But it's all FLYING right over your head.""
Hypothesis: ""But it's all sticking in your head.""

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Premise: ""FLYING right over your head"" suggests that something is not being understood or is being missed.
   - Hypothesis: ""sticking in your head"" suggests that something is being understood or remembered.

2. **Compare the key elements:**
   - The Premise indicates a lack of understanding or comprehension.
   - The Hypothesis indicates the opposite, that there is understanding or retention.

3. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Premise and Hypothesis present opposite situations. If something is ""flying right over your head,"" it cannot simultaneously be ""sticking in your head.""

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,But it's all FLYING right over your head.,But it's all going right over your head.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise:** ""But it's all FLYING right over your head.""
2. **Hypothesis:** ""But it's all going right over your head.""

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

- **Lexical Comparison:** The key difference between the Premise and the Hypothesis is the word ""FLYING"" in the Premise and ""going"" in the Hypothesis.
- **Semantic Analysis:** The phrase ""flying right over your head"" and ""going right over your head"" are semantically very similar. Both phrases imply that something is being missed or not understood by the person being addressed.
- **Contextual Consistency:** The context of both sentences is consistent. The use of ""FLYING"" versus ""going"" does not change the overall meaning of the sentence. Both convey the idea that something is not being comprehended.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because the slight lexical difference does not alter the meaning.

**Conclusion:**
The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise describes a situation where a person feels like they are floating along fine, but then suddenly experiences a strong urge to smoke.
   - This suggests a struggle with smoking urges, but it does not provide any information about swimming or cardiovascular exercises.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that quitting smoking may improve one's ability to swim and complete other cardiovascular exercises.
   - This hypothesis is making a general claim about the benefits of quitting smoking on physical activities, specifically swimming and cardiovascular exercises.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise does not mention anything about quitting smoking, swimming, or cardiovascular exercises.
   - The hypothesis introduces new information that is not present in the premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the hypothesis introduces new information that is not directly related to the premise, we cannot definitively say that the hypothesis is true or false based on the premise alone.
   - The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to support or contradict the hypothesis.

Therefore, the appropriate relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise describes a situation where you feel like you are ""floating along fine"" and then suddenly experience a ""huge swell of the urge to smoke.""
   - Key points: ""floating along fine"" (implies a state of ease or normalcy), ""huge swell of the urge to smoke"" (implies a sudden, strong desire to smoke).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis describes a situation where you feel ""stopped, unable to move"" and then ""finally you are freed by the urge to smoke.""
   - Key points: ""stopped, unable to move"" (implies a state of being stuck or immobilized), ""freed by the urge to smoke"" (implies that the urge to smoke releases you from this state).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise and hypothesis describe different initial states: ""floating along fine"" vs. ""stopped, unable to move.""
   - The premise describes the urge to smoke as a sudden, overwhelming feeling, while the hypothesis describes it as something that frees you from being stuck.
   - These descriptions are contradictory because the initial states and the effects of the urge to smoke are opposite.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis cannot be true given the premise because they describe fundamentally different experiences and effects of the urge to smoke.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise describes a situation where a person feels like they are floating along fine, but then suddenly experiences a strong urge to smoke.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that in an instant, a person will be caught up in a huge urge to smoke after feeling like they are floating along fine.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The hypothesis essentially rephrases the premise. Both the premise and the hypothesis describe the same sequence of events: feeling fine and then suddenly experiencing a strong urge to smoke.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the hypothesis is a restatement of the premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

intransitive-motion,schematic,The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.,Laws change all the time throughout the years.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.
Hypothesis: Laws change all the time throughout the years.

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The Premise suggests that the law is expected to change frequently (""jump back and forth"") in the future (""in the coming years"").
   
2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that laws change frequently over time (""all the time throughout the years"").

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise talks about the future, indicating that the law will likely change frequently in the coming years.
   - The Hypothesis makes a general statement about the nature of laws changing frequently over time.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Premise does not definitively confirm or deny the general statement made in the Hypothesis. It only suggests a probable future scenario.
   - The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it is not definitively confirmed by it. The Premise does not provide enough information to conclude that laws change ""all the time"" throughout the years, only that they will likely change frequently in the future.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise:** ""The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.""
   - This suggests that the law is expected to change frequently and unpredictably in the future.

2. **Hypothesis:** ""The law will probably stay the same in the coming years.""
   - This suggests that the law is expected to remain stable and unchanged in the future.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise indicates frequent changes in the law.
   - The Hypothesis indicates no changes in the law.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the law is expected to change frequently (as stated in the Premise), it cannot simultaneously be expected to stay the same (as stated in the Hypothesis).

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

intransitive-motion,schematic,The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.,In the coming years the law will most likely jump back and forth.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.""
   - This statement suggests that there is a likelihood or probability that the law will change or fluctuate in the future.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""In the coming years the law will most likely jump back and forth.""
   - This statement also suggests that it is likely or probable that the law will change or fluctuate in the future.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same idea: that the law is expected to change or fluctuate in the coming years.
   - The use of ""probably"" in the Premise and ""most likely"" in the Hypothesis are synonymous in this context, both indicating a high probability but not certainty.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise and conveys the same meaning, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.,The 23 are scared the sub is sinking.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**: ""The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.""
   - This indicates that a group of 23 individuals is moving quickly and in a panicked manner to the back of a submarine.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**: ""The 23 are scared the sub is sinking.""
   - This suggests that the reason for their frantic movement is fear that the submarine is sinking.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a frantic movement to the rear of the submarine, which implies a sense of urgency or panic.
   - The Hypothesis provides a possible reason for this behavior, which is fear of the submarine sinking.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true, the Premise must explicitly state or strongly imply that the reason for the frantic movement is fear of sinking. The Premise does not provide this explicit reason.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise. The Premise describes frantic behavior, which could be due to fear of sinking, but it could also be due to other reasons (e.g., an emergency drill, another type of danger, etc.).
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise indicated a different reason for the frantic movement or if it stated that the submarine is not sinking. The Premise does not provide such contradictory information.

Given that the Premise does not explicitly confirm or deny the reason for the frantic movement, the Hypothesis remains a plausible explanation but not a certain one.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.,The 23 were calm at the rear of the sub.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.""
Hypothesis: ""The 23 were calm at the rear of the sub.""

1. **Identify Key Information in the Premise:**
   - The phrase ""frantically SCRAMBLED"" indicates a sense of urgency and lack of calmness.
   - The action is directed towards the ""rear of the sub.""

2. **Identify Key Information in the Hypothesis:**
   - The phrase ""were calm"" indicates a state of being relaxed and not frantic.
   - The location mentioned is ""at the rear of the sub.""

3. **Compare the Key Information:**
   - The Premise describes the 23 individuals as being frantic and scrambling, which is the opposite of being calm.
   - The Hypothesis describes the 23 individuals as being calm, which directly contradicts the frantic behavior described in the Premise.

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - Since the Hypothesis states that the 23 were calm, which is the opposite of the frantic behavior described in the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a Contradiction.

intransitive-motion,schematic,The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.,The rear of the sub had 23 frantically scrambling towards it.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.""
   - This sentence indicates that a group of 23 individuals (or entities) moved quickly and in a disorganized manner towards the rear of the submarine.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The rear of the sub had 23 frantically scrambling towards it.""
   - This sentence suggests that the rear of the submarine was the destination for 23 individuals (or entities) who were moving quickly and in a disorganized manner.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: 23 individuals (or entities) moving frantically towards the rear of the submarine.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and does not add or contradict any information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that IRNA reported that Gomshadzehi killed a policeman and then escaped to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates while trafficking drugs in 2003.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that there is a criminal named Gomshadzehi who did not care about the lives of others or himself when he carried out his crimes in 2003.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise provides specific details about Gomshadzehi's actions: killing a policeman, escaping to Dubai, and trafficking drugs in 2003.
   - The hypothesis makes a general statement about Gomshadzehi's disregard for the lives of others or himself during his crimes in 2003.

4. **Inference Relationship**:
   - The hypothesis is a generalization based on the specific actions described in the premise. The actions of killing a policeman and trafficking drugs can reasonably lead to the conclusion that Gomshadzehi did not care about the lives of others or himself.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis is supported by the premise, as the specific actions described in the premise imply a lack of regard for life.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

### Premise:
""IRNA reported that Gomshadzehi killed a policeman and then ESCAPED to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates while trafficking drugs in 2003.""

### Hypothesis:
""IRNA reported that Gomshadzehi helped a policeman and was captive in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates while trafficking drugs in 2003.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Action Involving the Policeman:**
   - **Premise:** Gomshadzehi killed a policeman.
   - **Hypothesis:** Gomshadzehi helped a policeman.
   - **Analysis:** These actions are contradictory. Killing and helping are opposite actions.

2. **Status in Dubai:**
   - **Premise:** Gomshadzehi escaped to Dubai.
   - **Hypothesis:** Gomshadzehi was captive in Dubai.
   - **Analysis:** Escaping and being captive are contradictory states. If someone escaped, they are not captive.

3. **Context of Drug Trafficking:**
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis mention that the events occurred while trafficking drugs in 2003.
   - **Analysis:** This part is consistent between the Premise and Hypothesis.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis presents information that directly contradicts the actions and status described in the Premise. Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

   - Armed troops marched to the substations.
   - They turned the power back on.

2. **Identify the main events and entities in the Hypothesis:**
   - Armed troops marched to the substations.
   - The substations powered over half of the city.

3. **Compare the events and entities:**
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis mention that armed troops marched to the substations.
   - The Premise states that the troops turned the power back on, but the Hypothesis does not mention this action.
   - The Hypothesis adds additional information that the substations powered over half of the city, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information (the substations powered over half of the city) that is not present in the Premise.
   - This new information does not contradict the Premise, but it is also not entailed by it. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the additional detail about the substations powering over half of the city.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

   - The key point here is the phrase ""once you retire,"" which implies a voluntary departure.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise talks about being ""kicked out,"" which is an involuntary action.
   - The hypothesis talks about ""retiring,"" which is a voluntary action.
   - These two scenarios are fundamentally different: being kicked out is not the same as retiring.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the premise and the hypothesis describe different scenarios (involuntary departure vs. voluntary retirement), the hypothesis cannot be true given the premise.
   - Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction.

Based on this analysis, the correct relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that if someone thinks that Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out, they should talk to a retiree.
   - This implies that talking to a retiree will reveal the truth about whether Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that if someone thinks that Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out, they should not bother talking to a retiree.
   - This implies that talking to a retiree is unnecessary or unhelpful in revealing the truth about whether Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise suggests that talking to a retiree is a recommended action to understand the situation.
   - The hypothesis suggests the opposite, that talking to a retiree is not recommended.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. The premise recommends an action (talking to a retiree), while the hypothesis advises against it.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

caused-motion,schematic,If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they KICK you out the door talk to a retiree.,Talk to a retiree if any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they kick you out the door.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the steps:

1. **Understand the Premise**: 
   - The Premise states that if someone thinks that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them once they are kicked out, they should talk to a retiree.

2. **Understand the Hypothesis**: 
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise: it suggests talking to a retiree if someone thinks that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them once they are kicked out.

3. **Compare the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a restatement of the Premise with the same meaning and intent. It does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.

4. **Determine the Relationship**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and conveys the same information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

Premise: ""I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.""
Hypothesis: ""It is challenging for them to understand what is allowed to happen.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The speaker is expressing difficulty in understanding how a certain situation was permitted to occur.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The hypothesis states that it is challenging for ""them"" (which can be inferred to mean the speaker) to understand what is allowed to happen.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The premise indicates a personal difficulty in understanding a situation.
   - The hypothesis generalizes this difficulty to understanding what is allowed to happen.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The hypothesis is a rephrasing of the premise, indicating the same difficulty in understanding.
   - There is no new information or contradiction introduced by the hypothesis.
   - The hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment

The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

1. **Premise**: ""I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker is unable to understand how a certain situation occurred.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""I can understand perfectly how this was allowed to happen.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker has a clear understanding of how the situation occurred.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states a lack of understanding.
   - The Hypothesis states a clear understanding.

4. **Inference**:
   - The two statements are directly opposite in meaning. The Premise indicates confusion or lack of understanding, while the Hypothesis indicates complete understanding.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

caused-motion,schematic,I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.,"How any of this was allowed to happen, I can't wrap my head around.",0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.
Hypothesis: How any of this was allowed to happen, I can't wrap my head around.

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.""
   - The Hypothesis states: ""How any of this was allowed to happen, I can't wrap my head around.""

2. **Paraphrasing Check**:
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise. It uses the same words but in a different order.
   - Both sentences convey the same meaning: the speaker is expressing confusion or disbelief about how a certain situation was allowed to occur.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is just a rephrased version of the Premise, it does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.
   - The meaning remains unchanged, and the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment

Therefore, the output is:

caused-motion,schematic,The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.,The MiG-25 is well-equipped compared to the Predator.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

Premise: The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.
Hypothesis: The MiG-25 is well-equipped compared to the Predator.

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The MiG-25 is an aircraft.
   - It fired an AAM (Air-to-Air Missile) at the Predator (which is likely another aircraft or drone).

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis suggests that the MiG-25 is well-equipped compared to the Predator.

3. **Evaluating the Relationship**:
   - The Premise states a specific action (firing an AAM) but does not provide explicit information about the overall equipment or capabilities of the MiG-25 compared to the Predator.
   - The Hypothesis makes a general statement about the relative equipment levels of the MiG-25 and the Predator, which is not directly supported or contradicted by the specific action mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Determining the Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the general statement made in the Hypothesis, the relationship is not one of Entailment (0) or Contradiction (2).
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, making the relationship Neutral (1).

Therefore, the relation is:

caused-motion,schematic,The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.,The MiG-25 ceased fire at the Predator.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.""
   - This statement indicates that the MiG-25 launched an air-to-air missile (AAM) targeting the Predator.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The MiG-25 ceased fire at the Predator.""
   - This statement suggests that the MiG-25 stopped firing at the Predator.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the MiG-25 fired a missile, which implies active engagement.
   - The Hypothesis states that the MiG-25 stopped firing, which implies the cessation of engagement.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the MiG-25 is firing (as stated in the Premise), it cannot simultaneously be ceasing fire (as stated in the Hypothesis).

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2

1. **Premise:** ""The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.""
2. **Hypothesis:** ""The Predator had an AAM fired at them by the MiG-25.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Subject and Object Consistency:**
  - In the Premise, the subject is ""The MiG-25"" and the object is ""the Predator.""
  - In the Hypothesis, the subject is ""The Predator"" and the object is ""the MiG-25.""

- **Action Consistency:**
  - The action in the Premise is ""FIRED an AAM at.""
  - The action in the Hypothesis is ""had an AAM fired at them by.""

- **Paraphrasing Check:**
  - The Hypothesis is essentially a passive voice transformation of the active voice Premise.
  - Both statements convey the same event: the MiG-25 firing an AAM at the Predator.

### Conclusion:
- The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because it is a rephrased version of the same event described in the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

caused-motion,schematic,"Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.","Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base in Germany, where he stayed for weeks.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

**Premise:** Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.

**Hypothesis:** Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base in Germany, where he stayed for weeks.

1. **Check for Entailment (0):**
   - The Premise states that Pope was flown to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.
   - The Hypothesis states that Pope was flown to a U.S. military base in Germany and adds that he stayed there for weeks.
   - The first part of the Hypothesis (Pope was flown to a U.S. military base in Germany) is entailed by the Premise.
   - However, the second part of the Hypothesis (where he stayed for weeks) is not mentioned in the Premise. Therefore, we cannot confirm this additional information based solely on the Premise.

2. **Check for Contradiction (2):**
   - There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the Hypothesis. The Premise does not state anything about the duration of Pope's stay, so the Hypothesis is not directly contradicted.

3. **Check for Neutral (1):**
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information (the duration of the stay) that is not present in the Premise.
   - Since the additional information (staying for weeks) may or may not be true based on the Premise, the relationship is neutral.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1. **Premise**: ""Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.""
   - This statement asserts that Pope was transported by air to a specific location, which is the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Pope didn't fly to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.""
   - This statement asserts the opposite of the Premise, stating that Pope did not fly to the specified location.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that Pope was flown to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that Pope did not fly to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.

Given that the Hypothesis directly negates the information provided in the Premise, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the appropriate numerical value for the relation is:

   - Action: was flown
   - Location: U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - Subject: It (referring to the military base at Ramstein, Germany)
   - Action: was flown to
   - Object: Pope

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the same subject (Pope) and the same location (U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany).
   - The action (was flown to) is also consistent between the Premise and the Hypothesis.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. It does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

**Premise:** Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali and jailed for 20 years.

**Hypothesis:** Schapelle Corby, who was Australian, got caught and was imprisoned for something illegal.

1. **Identify Key Information in the Premise:**
   - Schapelle Corby is Australian.
   - She was convicted of trafficking marijuana.
   - The location of the crime was Bali.
   - She was jailed for 20 years.

2. **Identify Key Information in the Hypothesis:**
   - Schapelle Corby is Australian.
   - She got caught.
   - She was imprisoned.
   - The reason for imprisonment was something illegal.

3. **Compare the Information:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that Schapelle Corby is Australian.
   - The Hypothesis states she got caught and was imprisoned, which aligns with the Premise stating she was convicted and jailed.
   - The Hypothesis mentions ""something illegal,"" which is consistent with the Premise stating she was convicted of trafficking marijuana (an illegal activity).

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict any information in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a generalization of the specific details in the Premise but does not introduce any new or conflicting information.

1. **Premise**: ""Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali and jailed for 20 years.""
   - Key information: Schapelle Corby was convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali and received a 20-year jail sentence.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of removing marijuana from Bali and jailed for 20 years.""
   - Key information: Schapelle Corby was convicted of removing marijuana from Bali and received a 20-year jail sentence.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Schapelle Corby was convicted of trafficking marijuana **into** Bali.
   - The Hypothesis states that Schapelle Corby was convicted of removing marijuana **from** Bali.

4. **Inference Analysis**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are opposite in direction: ""trafficking into"" vs. ""removing from.""
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true because the direction of the trafficking is fundamentally different.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Premise: Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali and jailed for 20 years.
Hypothesis: Australian Schapelle Corby was jailed for 20 years because he was convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali.

1. **Check for Entailment (0):**
   - The Premise states that Schapelle Corby was convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali and was jailed for 20 years.
   - The Hypothesis states that Schapelle Corby was jailed for 20 years because he was convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise, maintaining the same meaning and causal relationship.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

2. **Check for Neutral (1):**

### Premise:
""The Pakistan-born man was then DEPORTED to the United Kingdom on 070713.""

### Hypothesis:
""The man from Pakistan went against his will to the United Kingdom for a crime committed.""

### Analysis:
1. **Premise Details**:
   - A man born in Pakistan.
   - He was deported to the United Kingdom.
   - The deportation occurred on 070713 (July 7, 2013).

2. **Hypothesis Details**:
   - The man is from Pakistan.
   - He went to the United Kingdom against his will.
   - The reason for going to the United Kingdom is a crime committed.

### Step-by-Step Comparison:
1. **Nationality and Movement**:
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis agree that the man is from Pakistan and went to the United Kingdom.

2. **Volition**:
   - The Premise states he was ""deported,"" which implies he was sent against his will.
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states he went ""against his will,"" which aligns with the implication of deportation.

3. **Reason for Deportation**:
   - The Premise does not provide a reason for the deportation.
   - The Hypothesis states it was for a crime committed.

### Conclusion:
- The Premise and Hypothesis agree on the man's nationality and the fact that he went to the United Kingdom against his will.
- The Premise does not specify the reason for deportation, while the Hypothesis assumes it was due to a crime. This additional detail in the Hypothesis is not confirmed nor denied by the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis introduces a specific reason (a crime) that is not mentioned in the Premise, it is possible but not certain. Therefore, the relationship is **Neutral**.

caused-motion,schematic,The Pakistan-born man was then DEPORTED to the United Kingdom on 070713.,The Pakistan-born man was then allowed to stay in the United Kingdom on 070713.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The Pakistan-born man was then DEPORTED to the United Kingdom on 070713.""
   - This statement indicates that the man was sent out of a country and sent to the United Kingdom on the specified date.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The Pakistan-born man was then allowed to stay in the United Kingdom on 070713.""
   - This statement suggests that the man was permitted to remain in the United Kingdom on the same date.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the man was deported to the United Kingdom, which implies he was sent there, likely from another country.
   - The Hypothesis states that the man was allowed to stay in the United Kingdom, which is a different action from being deported.

4. **Inference**:
   - If someone is deported to a country, it generally means they are being sent there, not necessarily that they are allowed to stay there. The act of deportation and being allowed to stay are contradictory actions.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

1. **Premise**: ""The Pakistan-born man was then DEPORTED to the United Kingdom on 070713.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""On 070713 the Pakistan-born man was then deported to the United Kingdom.""

- **Content Analysis**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis contain the same information. They state that a Pakistan-born man was deported to the United Kingdom on the date 070713.
- **Order of Information**: The order of the information is slightly different, but the meaning remains unchanged.
- **Key Details**: Both statements mention the same person (Pakistan-born man), the same action (deported), the same destination (United Kingdom), and the same date (070713).

Since the Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

caused-motion,schematic,The pilot refused to ALLOW the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.,The Pakistan-born man was a threat to the pilot on the pilot's plane.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The pilot refused to ALLOW the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.""
   - This statement tells us that the pilot did not permit the Pakistan-born man to board the plane. The reason for this refusal is not explicitly stated.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The Pakistan-born man was a threat to the pilot on the pilot's plane.""
   - This statement suggests a specific reason for the pilot's refusal: that the Pakistan-born man was considered a threat.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about why the pilot refused to allow the man onto the plane. It only states the action (refusal) without giving a reason.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a specific reason (the man being a threat), which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the man was a threat. Since the Premise does not mention any reason for the refusal, we cannot definitively conclude that the man was a threat.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the reason for the refusal. It is possible that the man was a threat, but it is also possible that there were other reasons for the refusal.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that directly contradicts the idea that the man was a threat. Since the Premise does not provide any reason for the refusal, it does not contradict the Hypothesis.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

   - This statement clearly indicates that the pilot did not permit the Pakistan-born man to board the plane.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The pilot insisted on allowing the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.""
   - This statement suggests that the pilot was determined to permit the Pakistan-born man to board the plane.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the pilot refused to allow the man onto the plane.
   - The Hypothesis states that the pilot insisted on allowing the man onto the plane.

4. **Inference**:
   - The two statements are directly contradictory. The Premise says the pilot did not allow the man, while the Hypothesis says the pilot insisted on allowing the man.

**Hypothesis:** China confirmed on January 23, 2007 after 12 days of silence that China had FIRED a guided missile, JL-2 ""Ju Lang"" 2, into space.

1. **Check for Entailment (0):**
   - The Premise states that China fired a guided missile into space to destroy one of its satellites.
   - The Hypothesis states that the guided missile fired was specifically the JL-2 ""Ju Lang"" 2.
   - The Premise does not specify the type of missile, only that a guided missile was fired.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is not definitely true based on the information given in the Premise.

2. **Check for Contradiction (2):**
   - The Premise does not provide any information that contradicts the Hypothesis.
   - There is no information in the Premise that states the missile was not the JL-2 ""Ju Lang"" 2.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is not definitely false based on the information given in the Premise.

3. **Check for Neutral (1):**
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information (the specific type of missile, JL-2 ""Ju Lang"" 2) that is not mentioned in the Premise.

   - **Hypothesis:** China denied the action of firing a guided missile into space.

2. **Temporal Context:**
   - Both the Premise and Hypothesis refer to the same date, January 23, 2007, and mention a period of 12 days.

3. **Nature of the Statement:**
   - **Premise:** The statement is about confirmation.
   - **Hypothesis:** The statement is about denial.

4. **Contradiction Check:**
   - Confirmation and denial are opposite actions. If China confirmed an action, it cannot simultaneously deny the same action.

5. **Additional Details:**
   - The Premise mentions ""12 days of silence,"" while the Hypothesis mentions ""12 days of noise."" This difference in wording does not affect the core contradiction between confirmation and denial.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise because it states the opposite action (denial vs. confirmation) regarding the same event.

### Final Relation:
2 – Contradiction

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that Chinese officials announced on May 14, 2007, that China had launched a Chinese-manufactured communications satellite into orbit on behalf of Nigeria.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that Chinese officials announced on May 14, 2007, that China had returned a Chinese-manufactured communications satellite from orbit back to earth on behalf of Nigeria.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The key action in the Premise is ""launched into orbit,"" which means sending the satellite from Earth into space.
   - The key action in the Hypothesis is ""returned from orbit back to earth,"" which means bringing the satellite from space back to Earth.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are directly opposite to each other. Launching a satellite into orbit and returning a satellite from orbit are mutually exclusive events; they cannot both be true simultaneously for the same satellite at the same time.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

**Premise:** Chinese officials stated on May 14, 2007 that China had LAUNCHED a Chinese manufactured communications satellite into orbit on behalf of Nigeria.

**Hypothesis:** A Chinese manufactured communications satellite was launched into orbit by China on behalf of Nigeria the Chinese officials stated on May 14, 2007.

1. **Content Comparison:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the launch of a Chinese manufactured communications satellite into orbit by China on behalf of Nigeria.
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis specify that this information was stated by Chinese officials on May 14, 2007.

2. **Information Consistency:**
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details.
   - The core information remains the same: the launch event, the entities involved (China and Nigeria), and the date of the statement (May 14, 2007).

3. **Logical Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise with no additional or conflicting information.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,Kevin lifted the trumpet and filled the room with happy noise.,Kevin lifted the trumpet and played to an audience that filled the room.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Kevin lifted the trumpet and filled the room with happy noise.""
   - This statement tells us that Kevin played the trumpet and the sound filled the room, creating a happy atmosphere.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Kevin lifted the trumpet and played to an audience that filled the room.""
   - This statement suggests that Kevin played the trumpet to an audience, and the audience filled the room.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not mention an audience; it only mentions that the room was filled with happy noise.
   - The Hypothesis introduces the idea of an audience filling the room, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the presence of an audience.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is not definitely true (Entailment) nor definitely false (Contradiction) based on the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

Premise: Kevin lifted the trumpet and filled the room with happy noise.
Hypothesis: Kevin lowered the trumpet and filled the room with silence.

1. **Identify the key actions and states in the Premise:**
   - Kevin lifted the trumpet.
   - The room was filled with happy noise.

2. **Identify the key actions and states in the Hypothesis:**
   - Kevin lowered the trumpet.
   - The room was filled with silence.

3. **Compare the actions and states:**
   - The action of lifting the trumpet in the Premise is contrasted with lowering the trumpet in the Hypothesis.
   - The state of the room being filled with happy noise in the Premise is contrasted with the room being filled with silence in the Hypothesis.

4. **Determine the logical relationship:**
   - The actions and resulting states in the Hypothesis directly contradict those in the Premise. If Kevin lifted the trumpet and filled the room with happy noise, it cannot simultaneously be true that he lowered the trumpet and filled the room with silence.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship is a contradiction.

causative-with-CxN,partial,Kevin lifted the trumpet and filled the room with happy noise.,Kevin lifted the trumpet and made happy noise in the room.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: Kevin lifted the trumpet and filled the room with happy noise.
Hypothesis: Kevin lifted the trumpet and made happy noise in the room.

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - Kevin lifted the trumpet.
   - Filled the room with happy noise.

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - Kevin lifted the trumpet.
   - Made happy noise in the room.

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis state that Kevin lifted the trumpet.
   - The Premise says ""filled the room with happy noise,"" while the Hypothesis says ""made happy noise in the room.""

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The phrase ""filled the room with happy noise"" and ""made happy noise in the room"" convey the same meaning. Both indicate that happy noise was produced in the room by Kevin lifting the trumpet.

Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship is:

0 – Entailment

Therefore, the relation is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,Dude has filled the room with flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.,A man filled the room with sweet things for his significant other.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""Dude has filled the room with flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.""
Hypothesis: ""A man filled the room with sweet things for his significant other.""

1. **Paraphrasing and Synonyms**:
   - ""Dude"" and ""man"" are synonymous.
   - ""Flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards"" can be considered ""sweet things.""

2. **Context and Implication**:
   - The Premise describes a scenario where a room is filled with items typically associated with affection or romantic gestures.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that these items were intended for a significant other, which is a reasonable inference given the nature of the items mentioned.

3. **Checking for Contradiction**:
   - There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the Hypothesis. The Premise does not state who the items are for, but it does not rule out the possibility that they are for a significant other.

4. **Checking for Entailment**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state that the items are for a significant other, but it strongly implies it. However, it is not definite.

5. **Checking for Neutrality**:
   - The Hypothesis is a plausible interpretation of the Premise but is not definitively confirmed by it. The Premise allows for other possible interpretations (e.g., the items could be for a celebration, a friend, etc.).

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,Dude has filled the room with flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.,Dude has emptied the room of flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""Dude has filled the room with flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.""
Hypothesis: ""Dude has emptied the room of flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.""

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - The room is filled with flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards.
   - The action described is ""filled.""

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - The room is emptied of flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards.
   - The action described is ""emptied.""

3. **Compare the actions and states described:**
   - The Premise states that the room is filled with certain items.
   - The Hypothesis states that the room is emptied of those same items.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The actions ""filled"" and ""emptied"" are direct opposites.
   - If the room is filled with items, it cannot simultaneously be emptied of those items.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Dude has filled the room with flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.,Dude has moved flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards into the room.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Dude has filled the room with flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards.""
   - This indicates that the room is now full of flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards. The action of filling the room has been completed.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Dude has moved flowers and teddy bears and cheesy cards into the room.""
   - This suggests that the dude has transported flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards into the room. It does not necessarily imply that the room is filled, just that the items have been moved into the room.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the room is filled with the items, which implies that the items have been moved into the room and more.
   - The Hypothesis only states that the items have been moved into the room, which is a necessary part of filling the room but does not fully capture the extent of the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a subset of the Premise. If the room is filled with the items, it is definitely true that the items have been moved into the room.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,An enormous chandelier filled the room with a stunning display of reflected light.,The room had a grand crystal chandelier displayed in its center.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""An enormous chandelier filled the room with a stunning display of reflected light.""
   - This tells us that there is a large chandelier in the room, and it is creating a beautiful display of light.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The room had a grand crystal chandelier displayed in its center.""
   - This suggests that the room has a grand chandelier made of crystal, and it is positioned in the center of the room.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions an ""enormous chandelier"" that ""filled the room with a stunning display of reflected light."" It does not specify the material (crystal) or the exact position (center) of the chandelier.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that the chandelier is ""grand"" and ""crystal"" and is ""displayed in its center.""

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm that the chandelier is made of crystal or that it is positioned in the center of the room. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the Hypothesis is true based on the Premise alone.
   - However, the Hypothesis is not contradicted by the Premise either. The chandelier could very well be crystal and in the center, but this is not explicitly stated in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

causative-with-CxN,partial,An enormous chandelier filled the room with a stunning display of reflected light.,A small chandelier filled the room with an ordinary display of reflected light.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: An enormous chandelier filled the room with a stunning display of reflected light.
Hypothesis: A small chandelier filled the room with an ordinary display of reflected light.

1. **Identify Key Elements in the Premise:**
   - ""An enormous chandelier""
   - ""filled the room""
   - ""with a stunning display of reflected light""

2. **Identify Key Elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - ""A small chandelier""
   - ""filled the room""
   - ""with an ordinary display of reflected light""

3. **Compare the Key Elements:**
   - The size of the chandelier in the Premise is ""enormous,"" while in the Hypothesis, it is ""small.""
   - The type of display in the Premise is ""stunning,"" while in the Hypothesis, it is ""ordinary.""

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise in terms of the size of the chandelier and the type of display it produces. The Premise describes an enormous chandelier with a stunning display, whereas the Hypothesis describes a small chandelier with an ordinary display.

Given these points, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Premise: An enormous chandelier filled the room with a stunning display of reflected light.
Hypothesis: A stunning display of reflected light filled the room from the enormous chandelier.

1. **Content Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that an enormous chandelier filled the room with a stunning display of reflected light.
   - The Hypothesis states that a stunning display of reflected light filled the room from the enormous chandelier.

2. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: an enormous chandelier creating a stunning display of reflected light that fills the room.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise and does not add or contradict any information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,"Freshly ground coffee beans filled the room with a seductive, earthy aroma.",Aromatic coffee beans were ground for a fresh cup of coffee.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Freshly ground coffee beans filled the room with a seductive, earthy aroma.""
   - This sentence tells us that coffee beans have been ground recently, and as a result, the room is filled with a pleasant, earthy smell.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Aromatic coffee beans were ground for a fresh cup of coffee.""
   - This sentence suggests that coffee beans, which are aromatic, were ground with the intention of making a fresh cup of coffee.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions that the coffee beans were freshly ground and filled the room with an aroma.
   - The Hypothesis states that the aromatic coffee beans were ground for a fresh cup of coffee.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state the purpose of grinding the coffee beans (i.e., for a fresh cup of coffee), but it is a reasonable assumption that freshly ground coffee beans are typically used to make coffee.
   - The Hypothesis adds an additional detail (the purpose of grinding the beans) that is not explicitly mentioned in the Premise but is a plausible scenario.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the purpose of grinding the coffee beans.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

### Premise:
""Freshly ground coffee beans filled the room with a seductive, earthy aroma.""

### Hypothesis:
""Stale whole coffee beans filled the room with an unattractive, otherworldly scent.""

### Analysis:
1. **Freshly ground coffee beans** vs. **Stale whole coffee beans**:
   - The Premise mentions ""freshly ground coffee beans,"" while the Hypothesis mentions ""stale whole coffee beans."" These are two different states of coffee beans, implying a significant difference in freshness and form.

2. **Seductive, earthy aroma** vs. **Unattractive, otherworldly scent**:
   - The Premise describes the aroma as ""seductive"" and ""earthy,"" which are positive and appealing descriptors.
   - The Hypothesis describes the scent as ""unattractive"" and ""otherworldly,"" which are negative and unappealing descriptors.

### Conclusion:
- The Premise and Hypothesis describe completely opposite states of coffee beans (freshly ground vs. stale whole) and their resulting aromas (seductive, earthy vs. unattractive, otherworldly).
- Given the stark contrast in both the state of the coffee beans and the description of their scents, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

### Final Answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,"Freshly ground coffee beans filled the room with a seductive, earthy aroma.","The room was filled with a seductive, earthly aroma from freshly ground coffee beans.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: Freshly ground coffee beans filled the room with a seductive, earthy aroma.
Hypothesis: The room was filled with a seductive, earthly aroma from freshly ground coffee beans.

1. **Content Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention ""freshly ground coffee beans.""
   - Both state that these coffee beans filled the room with an aroma.
   - The adjectives ""seductive"" and ""earthy"" are used in both, though the Hypothesis uses ""earthly"" instead of ""earthy."" This seems to be a minor typographical error and does not change the meaning significantly.

2. **Semantic Equivalence**:
   - The Hypothesis essentially rephrases the Premise without introducing any new information or contradictions.
   - The meaning conveyed by both sentences is the same: the aroma from freshly ground coffee beans filled the room.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - There is no information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any uncertainty or additional context that would make it only possibly true (neutral).

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the same information without any contradictions or additional context, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

1. **Premise**: ""Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.""
   - This statement indicates that Samsung has extensively advertised their products.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Samsung has flooded the market with tasteful, funny ads.""
   - This statement suggests that the advertisements Samsung has used are specifically tasteful and funny.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that Samsung has done a lot of advertising.
   - The Hypothesis adds a specific quality to the advertisements (tasteful and funny) that is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must imply that the ads are tasteful and funny. The Premise does not provide any information about the nature of the ads.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true or false based on the Premise. The Premise does not give enough information to confirm or deny the specific qualities of the ads.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to imply that the ads are not tasteful and funny. The Premise does not provide any information that contradicts the Hypothesis.

Given that the Premise does not provide information about the specific qualities of the ads, the Hypothesis may or may not be true.

Therefore, the relation is:

Premise: ""Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.""
Hypothesis: ""The market is flooded with Samsung's advertising.""

1. **Check for Entailment (0)**:
   - The Hypothesis states that ""The market is flooded with Samsung's advertising.""
   - The Premise states that ""Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.""
   - Both statements convey the same information: Samsung's advertising is prevalent in the market.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

2. **Check for Neutral (1)**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise, it is not a case where the Hypothesis may or may not be true. It is definitively true.

3. **Check for Contradiction (2)**:
   - There is no contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis. They both state the same fact.

Given the analysis, the correct relation is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.,Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil that was sold to at least five countries.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.""

Hypothesis: ""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil that was sold to at least five countries.""

1. **Identify the main information in the Premise:**
   - Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil.
   - The purpose was to recover their market share.

2. **Identify the main information in the Hypothesis:**
   - Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil.
   - The oil was sold to at least five countries.

3. **Compare the information:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil.
   - The Hypothesis adds a specific detail that the oil was sold to at least five countries, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information (the oil being sold to at least five countries) that is not present in the Premise.
   - This new information is not contradicted by the Premise, but it is also not entailed by it. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the specific detail about the number of countries.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is Neutral.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.,Saudi reduced the market's supply of cheap oil so they could deteriorate their market share.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

**Premise:** Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.

**Hypothesis:** Saudi reduced the market's supply of cheap oil so they could deteriorate their market share.

1. **Identify the key actions and intentions in the Premise:**
   - Action: Flooded the market with cheap oil.
   - Intention: To recover their market share.

2. **Identify the key actions and intentions in the Hypothesis:**
   - Action: Reduced the market's supply of cheap oil.
   - Intention: To deteriorate their market share.

3. **Compare the actions:**
   - The Premise states that Saudi ""flooded the market"" (increased supply).
   - The Hypothesis states that Saudi ""reduced the market's supply"" (decreased supply).

   These actions are directly opposite to each other.

4. **Compare the intentions:**
   - The Premise states the intention was to ""recover their market share"" (improve their position).
   - The Hypothesis states the intention was to ""deteriorate their market share"" (worsen their position).

   These intentions are also directly opposite to each other.

Given that both the actions and intentions in the Hypothesis are directly contradictory to those in the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

**Conclusion:**
The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

causative-with-CxN,partial,Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.,"To recover their market share, Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil.",0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.""
Hypothesis: ""To recover their market share, Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil.""

1. **Identify the main components of the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Premise: Saudi's action of flooding the market with cheap oil was done with the intention of recovering their market share.
   - Hypothesis: Saudi's action of flooding the market with cheap oil was done with the intention of recovering their market share.

2. **Compare the content:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event and intention: Saudi flooding the market with cheap oil to recover their market share.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise, maintaining the same meaning and causal relationship.

3. **Determine the relationship:**
   - Since the Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise with no additional information or contradiction, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.,"The Chinese have the largest, juiciest apples on the market.",1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.
Hypothesis: The Chinese have the largest, juiciest apples on the market.

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The Premise states that the Chinese have flooded the market with juice-grade apples. This implies a large quantity of apples suitable for making juice is available in the market due to Chinese suppliers.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis claims that the Chinese have the largest, juiciest apples on the market. This statement is about the quality and size of the apples, suggesting they are the best in terms of size and juiciness.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise focuses on the quantity and type (juice-grade) of apples, not on their size or juiciness.
   - The Hypothesis makes a qualitative claim about the apples being the largest and juiciest, which is not addressed in the Premise.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Premise does not provide information about the size or juiciness of the apples, only that there are many juice-grade apples from China.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information given in the Premise. There is no direct contradiction or confirmation.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.,The Chinese already have under produced in the market with juice-grade apples.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.""
   - This means that there is an abundance or oversupply of juice-grade apples in the market due to Chinese production.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""The Chinese already have under produced in the market with juice-grade apples.""
   - This means that there is a shortage or insufficient supply of juice-grade apples in the market due to Chinese production.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that there is an oversupply (""flooded the market"").
   - The Hypothesis states that there is an undersupply (""under produced"").

4. **Inference**:
   - The two statements are directly contradictory. If the market is flooded with juice-grade apples, it cannot simultaneously be under produced.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.,Juice-grade apples have already been flooded in the market by the Chinese.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.""
   - This statement indicates that the Chinese have introduced a large quantity of juice-grade apples into the market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Juice-grade apples have already been flooded in the market by the Chinese.""
   - This statement is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. It conveys the same information: the Chinese have introduced a large quantity of juice-grade apples into the market.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same information using different wording.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis.

Given that the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the same information, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.,He turned his face to the wall and covered it out of embarrassment.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.""
Hypothesis: ""He turned his face to the wall and covered it out of embarrassment.""

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that he turned to the wall and covered his face with a pillow.
   - The Hypothesis states that he turned his face to the wall and covered it out of embarrassment.

2. **Information Comparison**:
   - The action described in the Premise (turning to the wall and covering his face with a pillow) is consistent with the action described in the Hypothesis (turning his face to the wall and covering it).
   - The Hypothesis adds an additional detail about the reason for the action (out of embarrassment), which is not mentioned in the Premise.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new element (embarrassment) that is not present in the Premise. This means the Hypothesis is not definitely true based on the Premise alone.
   - However, the Hypothesis is not contradicted by the Premise. The additional detail about embarrassment is plausible but not certain from the given information.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

Premise: Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.
Hypothesis: Turning away from the wall he uncovered his face with a pillow.

1. **Identify the main actions in the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Premise: ""Turning to the wall"" and ""covered his face with a pillow.""
   - Hypothesis: ""Turning away from the wall"" and ""uncovered his face with a pillow.""

2. **Compare the actions and directions:**
   - The Premise states that the person is turning towards the wall and covering their face with a pillow.
   - The Hypothesis states that the person is turning away from the wall and uncovering their face with a pillow.

3. **Determine if the actions and directions are consistent or contradictory:**
   - The actions in the Hypothesis are the opposite of those in the Premise. The Premise describes covering the face while turning to the wall, whereas the Hypothesis describes uncovering the face while turning away from the wall.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The actions and directions in the Hypothesis directly contradict those in the Premise. Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.,He covered his face with a pillow as he turned toward the wall.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.""
Hypothesis: ""He covered his face with a pillow as he turned toward the wall.""

1. **Identify the actions and their sequence in the Premise:**
   - Action 1: Turning to the wall.
   - Action 2: Covering his face with a pillow.

2. **Identify the actions and their sequence in the Hypothesis:**
   - Action 1: Covering his face with a pillow.
   - Action 2: Turning toward the wall.

3. **Compare the sequences:**
   - In the Premise, the sequence is: Turning to the wall → Covering his face with a pillow.
   - In the Hypothesis, the sequence is: Covering his face with a pillow → Turning toward the wall.

4. **Determine if the sequences are logically equivalent:**
   - The actions described in both the Premise and the Hypothesis are the same, but the order in which they are mentioned is different.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but does not change the meaning or introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise and does not contradict it.
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

**Premise:** The school filled his head with knowledge, challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.

**Hypothesis:** The school imparted pertinent, real-world knowledge and challenged him with tests, quizzes and homework.

1. **Content Analysis:**
   - The Premise states that the school filled his head with knowledge and challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.
   - The Hypothesis states that the school imparted pertinent, real-world knowledge and challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.

2. **Comparison:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that the school challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.
   - The main difference lies in the type of knowledge mentioned. The Premise simply states ""knowledge,"" while the Hypothesis specifies ""pertinent, real-world knowledge.""

3. **Inference Determination:**
   - The Hypothesis adds a qualifier to the type of knowledge (""pertinent, real-world""), which is not explicitly stated in the Premise.
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm whether the knowledge was ""pertinent"" and ""real-world"" or not. It only mentions ""knowledge"" in a general sense.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, but it also does not fully support the specific claim about the type of knowledge.

**Conclusion:**
The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is Neutral.

### Premise:
""The school filled his head with knowledge, challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.""

### Hypothesis:
""The school emptied his head of knowledge, easing him with tests, quizzes, and homework.""

### Analysis:
1. **Content Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the school ""filled his head with knowledge"" and ""challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.""
   - The Hypothesis states that the school ""emptied his head of knowledge"" and ""eased him with tests, quizzes, and homework.""

2. **Contradiction Check**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis present opposite actions regarding knowledge: ""filled"" vs. ""emptied.""
   - The Premise describes the tests, quizzes, and homework as ""challenging,"" while the Hypothesis describes them as ""easing.""

3. **Entailment Check**:
   - The Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because the actions described are directly contradictory.

4. **Neutral Check**:
   - There is no scenario where both the Premise and Hypothesis can be true simultaneously, as they describe mutually exclusive situations.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and Hypothesis is a contradiction.

### Final Answer:

Premise: Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.
Hypothesis: Susan was a trapper by trade, specializing in mink hats.

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The Premise states that Susan trapped someone and filled his head with lies. This suggests deceit and manipulation but does not provide any information about Susan's profession or trade.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The Hypothesis claims that Susan was a trapper by trade, specializing in mink hats. This is a specific statement about Susan's profession.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The Premise does not mention anything about Susan's profession or trade. It only talks about her actions of trapping someone and lying.
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information that is not present in the Premise.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - Since the Premise does not provide any information about Susan's profession, we cannot definitively say that the Hypothesis is true or false based on the Premise alone.
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as there is no direct contradiction or confirmation.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is Neutral.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.""
   - This indicates that Susan has confined someone and deceived them by telling lies.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Susan let him free, cleared his head of lies.""
   - This suggests that Susan has released the person and removed the lies from their mind.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Susan trapped and deceived the person.
   - The Hypothesis states the opposite: that Susan freed and cleared the person's mind of lies.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict the actions described in the Premise.
   - If Susan trapped and filled his head with lies (Premise), she cannot simultaneously have let him free and cleared his head of lies (Hypothesis).

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The Premise states two actions: ""Susan trapped him"" and ""filled his head with lies.""
   - The Hypothesis states the same two actions but in reverse order: ""Susan filled his head with lies"" and ""trapped him.""

2. **Order of Events**:
   - The order of events in the Hypothesis is different from the Premise, but the content and the actions described are identical.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The order of events does not affect the truth of the actions themselves. Both statements describe the same set of actions performed by Susan.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis contains the same information as the Premise, just in a different order, it does not change the truth value of the actions described.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

Premise: They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.
Hypothesis: They made him give away pills that emptied his head of cold, silent noise.

1. **Subject Analysis**:
   - Premise: ""They made him take pills.""
   - Hypothesis: ""They made him give away pills.""

   The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are different. In the Premise, he is taking pills, while in the Hypothesis, he is giving away pills.

2. **Effect of the Action**:
   - Premise: The pills ""filled his head with cold, silent noise.""
   - Hypothesis: The pills ""emptied his head of cold, silent noise.""

   The effects described are opposite. In the Premise, the pills fill his head with noise, while in the Hypothesis, the pills empty his head of noise.

3. **Consistency Check**:
   - The actions and their effects in the Premise and Hypothesis are contradictory. The Premise states that taking pills fills his head with noise, while the Hypothesis states that giving away pills empties his head of noise. These two statements cannot both be true simultaneously.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

   - This sentence states that ""they"" (unspecified individuals) forced ""him"" (unspecified person) to take pills, and as a result, his head was filled with ""cold, silent noise.""

2. **Hypothesis**: ""His head was filled with cold, silent noise from pills they made him take.""
   - This sentence states that his head was filled with ""cold, silent noise"" and attributes this effect to the pills that ""they"" made him take.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: ""they"" made ""him"" take pills, and these pills caused his head to be filled with ""cold, silent noise.""
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise, maintaining the same meaning and causal relationship.

Given that the Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.,"There are other teachers, but one was trying to conceal her body with a sheet.",1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.""
Hypothesis: ""There are other teachers, but one was trying to conceal her body with a sheet.""

1. **Check for Entailment (0):**
   - The Premise states that ""one of the teachers"" covered her body with a black sheet.
   - The Hypothesis states that there are other teachers and one was trying to conceal her body with a sheet.
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise and is consistent with it. The Premise implies the existence of at least one teacher, and the Hypothesis suggests there are multiple teachers, which is not ruled out by the Premise.
   - The action of covering her body with a black sheet can be interpreted as trying to conceal her body.

2. **Check for Contradiction (2):**
   - There is no information in the Hypothesis that directly contradicts the Premise. Both statements can coexist without any logical conflict.

3. **Check for Neutral (1):**
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information (the existence of other teachers) that is not explicitly stated in the Premise but is not contradicted by it.
   - The Hypothesis is plausible given the Premise but is not definitively confirmed by it.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise, but it is not definitively confirmed or contradicted.

### Premise:
""One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.""

### Hypothesis:
""One of the teachers left after removing a black sheet from her body.""

### Analysis:
1. **Action in Premise**: A teacher covered her body with a black sheet.
2. **Action in Hypothesis**: A teacher left after removing a black sheet from her body.

### Comparison:
- The Premise describes an action where a teacher covers her body with a black sheet.
- The Hypothesis describes a different action where a teacher removes a black sheet from her body and then leaves.

### Inference:
- The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are contradictory. The Premise states that the teacher covered her body with a black sheet, while the Hypothesis states that the teacher removed a black sheet from her body and left. These two actions cannot both be true simultaneously in the same context.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.""
   - This sentence indicates that a teacher performed two actions: coming along and covering her body with a black sheet.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""One of the teachers covered her body with a black sheet after she came along.""
   - This sentence indicates that the teacher covered her body with a black sheet after coming along.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of events: the teacher came along and then covered her body with a black sheet.
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states the sequence using the word ""after,"" which is implied in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because it describes the same sequence of events without adding or contradicting any information.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

causative-with-CxN,partial,Howze filled her house with music and color.,Howze was the best roommate she had ever had.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: Howze filled her house with music and color.
Hypothesis: Howze was the best roommate she had ever had.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise states that Howze filled her house with music and color. This gives us information about Howze's actions and the environment she created in her house.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis claims that Howze was the best roommate she had ever had. This is a subjective statement about Howze's qualities as a roommate.

3. **Checking for Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be definitely true given the premise, the premise must provide sufficient information to conclude that Howze was the best roommate. The premise only describes Howze's actions related to music and color, but it does not provide any information about her overall qualities as a roommate or compare her to other roommates.

4. **Checking for Contradiction (2)**: For the hypothesis to be definitely false given the premise, the premise must provide information that directly contradicts the hypothesis. The premise does not provide any information that contradicts the claim that Howze was the best roommate.

5. **Checking for Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise provides some positive information about Howze (filling the house with music and color), but it does not provide enough information to determine whether she was the best roommate. Therefore, the hypothesis is possible but not certain based on the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,Howze filled her house with music and color.,Howze emptied her house of music and color.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: Howze filled her house with music and color.
Hypothesis: Howze emptied her house of music and color.

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - ""Howze filled her house with music and color.""

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - ""Howze emptied her house of music and color.""

3. **Compare the key elements:**
   - The Premise states that Howze filled her house with music and color, which means she added these elements to her house.
   - The Hypothesis states that Howze emptied her house of music and color, which means she removed these elements from her house.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are directly opposite to each other. Filling the house with music and color is the opposite of emptying the house of music and color.

Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise, the relationship is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Howze filled her house with music and color.,The house was filled with music and color by Howze.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Howze filled her house with music and color.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""The house was filled with music and color by Howze.""

- **Content Analysis**:
  - The Premise states that Howze is the agent who filled her house with music and color.
  - The Hypothesis rephrases the same information, indicating that the house was filled with music and color by Howze.

- **Paraphrasing Check**:
  - The Hypothesis is essentially a passive voice transformation of the active voice Premise.
  - Both sentences convey the exact same information.

- **Inference Relation**:
  - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the same meaning, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.,The red wine bottle was opened by him and he poured her a glass full of it.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.""

### Hypothesis:
""The red wine bottle was opened by him and he poured her a glass full of it.""

### Analysis:
1. **Cork and Pop**: The phrase ""The cork came out with a pleasant pop"" strongly suggests that a bottle was opened, and typically, this is associated with a wine bottle.
2. **Rich Red Liquid**: The description ""rich red liquid"" is commonly used to describe red wine.
3. **Filling Her Glass**: The action of filling her glass with the liquid aligns with the hypothesis that he poured her a glass full of it.

### Comparison:
- The Premise describes the action of opening a bottle (implied to be a wine bottle due to the cork and pop) and filling a glass with a red liquid.
- The Hypothesis explicitly states that the red wine bottle was opened and he poured her a glass full of it.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise with more explicit details about the type of liquid (red wine) and the action (pouring a glass). Given the information in the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true.

### Relation:
0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.,The cork came out with a horrible pop and he emptied her glass of the rich red liquid.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.
Hypothesis: The cork came out with a horrible pop and he emptied her glass of the rich red liquid.

1. **Compare the descriptions of the cork popping:**
   - Premise: ""The cork came out with a pleasant pop.""
   - Hypothesis: ""The cork came out with a horrible pop.""
   - These descriptions are contradictory. The pop cannot be both pleasant and horrible at the same time.

2. **Compare the actions related to the glass:**
   - Premise: ""He filled her glass with the rich red liquid.""
   - Hypothesis: ""He emptied her glass of the rich red liquid.""
   - These actions are also contradictory. He cannot both fill and empty the glass at the same time.

Given these contradictions in both the descriptions of the cork popping and the actions related to the glass, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.,He filled her glass with the rich red liquid that came from opening the cork with a pleasant pop.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.
Hypothesis: He filled her glass with the rich red liquid that came from opening the cork with a pleasant pop.

1. **Identify the key elements in the Premise:**
   - The cork came out with a pleasant pop.
   - He filled her glass with the rich red liquid.

2. **Identify the key elements in the Hypothesis:**
   - He filled her glass with the rich red liquid.
   - The liquid came from opening the cork with a pleasant pop.

3. **Compare the elements:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the cork coming out with a pleasant pop.
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention filling her glass with the rich red liquid.
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states that the rich red liquid came from the cork that popped, which is implied in the Premise.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise with a slight rephrasing but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,The waiter filled her glass with white wine.,She ordered the white wine in a glass.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The waiter filled her glass with white wine.""
   - This statement tells us that a waiter poured white wine into a glass that belongs to a female individual.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""She ordered the white wine in a glass.""
   - This statement suggests that the female individual requested white wine to be served in a glass.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about whether the woman ordered the white wine. It only states that the waiter filled her glass with white wine.
   - The Hypothesis introduces the idea that the woman ordered the white wine, which is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not confirm or deny whether the woman ordered the white wine, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the given information.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,The waiter filled her glass with white wine.,The waiter emptied her glass of white wine.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The waiter filled her glass with white wine.
Hypothesis: The waiter emptied her glass of white wine.

1. **Identify the main actions in the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Premise: The action is ""filled her glass with white wine.""
   - Hypothesis: The action is ""emptied her glass of white wine.""

2. **Compare the actions:**
   - ""Filled"" and ""emptied"" are opposite actions. If the glass is filled, it cannot be empty at the same time.

3. **Determine the logical relationship:**
   - Since the actions are contradictory, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Relation: 2",Relation: 2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,The waiter filled her glass with white wine.,Her glass was filled with white wine by the waiter.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""The waiter filled her glass with white wine.""
2. **Hypothesis**: ""Her glass was filled with white wine by the waiter.""

- **Step 1: Check for Entailment (0)**
  - The Hypothesis is a passive rephrasing of the Premise. Both sentences convey the exact same information: the waiter is the agent performing the action of filling the glass with white wine.
  - Since the Hypothesis is a direct restatement of the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

- **Step 2: Check for Contradiction (2)**
  - There is no information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise. Both sentences are consistent with each other.

- **Step 3: Check for Neutral (1)**
  - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that is uncertain or unrelated to the Premise. It is simply a rephrasing.

Given the analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

causative-with-CxN,partial,Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.,"After filling her pockets with rocks, Virginia Woolf walked into a river famous for its clear waters.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

**Premise:** Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.

**Hypothesis:** After filling her pockets with rocks, Virginia Woolf walked into a river famous for its clear waters.

1. **Check for Entailment (0):**
   - The Hypothesis states that Virginia Woolf walked into a river famous for its clear waters after filling her pockets with rocks.
   - The Premise does not specify any characteristics of the river, such as it being famous for its clear waters.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is not definitely true given the Premise because the specific detail about the river's clear waters is not mentioned in the Premise.

2. **Check for Contradiction (2):**
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise. Both statements agree that Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.
   - There is no information in the Hypothesis that directly contradicts the Premise.

3. **Check for Neutral (1):**
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information (the river being famous for its clear waters) that is not present in the Premise.
   - This additional detail makes the Hypothesis possible but not certain based on the Premise alone.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, making the relation **Neutral**.

**Relation: 1**",**Relation: 1**,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.,Virginia Woolf emptied her pockets of rocks and walked away from the river.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise**: ""Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.""
   - This statement describes an action where Virginia Woolf intentionally filled her pockets with rocks and then walked into a river.

2. **Hypothesis**: ""Virginia Woolf emptied her pockets of rocks and walked away from the river.""
   - This statement describes an action where Virginia Woolf emptied her pockets of rocks and then walked away from the river.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that Virginia Woolf walked into the river with rocks in her pockets.
   - The Hypothesis suggests the opposite action: she emptied her pockets of rocks and walked away from the river.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict the actions described in the Premise. If she walked into the river with rocks in her pockets, she could not have simultaneously emptied her pockets of rocks and walked away from the river.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.,Virginia Woolf walked into a river after filling her pockets with rocks.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.""
Hypothesis: ""Virginia Woolf walked into a river after filling her pockets with rocks.""

1. **Check for Entailment (0)**:
   - The Premise states that Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and then walked into a river.
   - The Hypothesis states that Virginia Woolf walked into a river after filling her pockets with rocks.
   - The sequence of events in the Hypothesis matches exactly with the sequence of events in the Premise.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

2. **Check for Neutral (1)**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, it cannot be neutral.

3. **Check for Contradiction (2)**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, it cannot be a contradiction.

Given the analysis, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.,Blizzards can be fun for children playing in the snow.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.""
   - This sentence describes a situation where a blizzard is actively covering people with snow. It implies a severe weather condition with heavy snowfall.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Blizzards can be fun for children playing in the snow.""
   - This sentence makes a general statement about blizzards potentially being enjoyable for children who are playing in the snow.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a specific event where a blizzard is covering bodies with snow, which suggests a potentially dangerous or severe situation.
   - The Hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a general statement about the potential enjoyment of blizzards for children.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not directly contradict the Premise, as it is possible for children to find blizzards fun in some contexts.
   - However, the Premise does not provide any information that would definitively support the idea that blizzards are fun for children. It focuses on the severity of the blizzard rather than any enjoyment derived from it.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1 – Neutral

So, the final output is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.,A blizzard soon took snow away from their bodies.,2,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.""
   - This means that a blizzard caused snow to accumulate on their bodies.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""A blizzard soon took snow away from their bodies.""
   - This means that a blizzard caused snow to be removed from their bodies.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the blizzard added snow to their bodies.
   - The Hypothesis states that the blizzard removed snow from their bodies.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are directly opposite to each other.
   - If the Premise is true (the blizzard covered their bodies with snow), then the Hypothesis (the blizzard took snow away from their bodies) cannot be true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.,Their bodies were soon covered with snow from the blizzard.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.
Hypothesis: Their bodies were soon covered with snow from the blizzard.

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that a blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.
   - The Hypothesis states that their bodies were soon covered with snow from the blizzard.

2. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: a blizzard covering their bodies with snow.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise without adding or contradicting any information.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The harder they come, the harder they fall.",They are likely to be injured if they fall hard.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The harder they come, the harder they fall.""
Hypothesis: ""They are likely to be injured if they fall hard.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The phrase ""The harder they come, the harder they fall"" is a proverbial expression. It suggests that those who are more powerful or confident (come harder) will experience a more significant downfall (fall harder) when they fail.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The hypothesis states that ""They are likely to be injured if they fall hard."" This implies a physical consequence (injury) resulting from a hard fall.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The premise is metaphorical and speaks about the magnitude of failure relative to the initial strength or confidence.
   - The hypothesis interprets the ""fall"" in a literal, physical sense, suggesting injury from a hard fall.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The premise does not explicitly mention physical injury or the likelihood of being injured. It is more about the severity of the downfall in a metaphorical sense.
   - The hypothesis introduces a new element (physical injury) that is not directly supported or contradicted by the premise.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis may or may not be true based on the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the likelihood of injury from a hard fall.

Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The harder they come, the harder they fall.",How hard they fall is dependent on their actions.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

Premise: ""The harder they come, the harder they fall.""
- This statement suggests a correlation between the intensity or difficulty of a situation and the severity of the consequences.

Hypothesis: ""How hard they fall is dependent on their actions.""
- This statement suggests that the severity of the consequences (how hard they fall) is influenced by their actions.

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Check for Entailment (0):**
   - Does the Premise definitively imply the Hypothesis?
   - The Premise talks about a correlation between the difficulty and the consequences but does not explicitly mention actions as a factor. Therefore, the Premise does not definitively imply the Hypothesis.

2. **Check for Contradiction (2):**
   - Does the Premise contradict the Hypothesis?
   - The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis. It is possible that the difficulty and actions both influence the consequences, so there is no direct contradiction.

3. **Check for Neutral (1):**
   - Is the Hypothesis a possible scenario given the Premise, but not definitively implied or contradicted?
   - The Hypothesis is a possible scenario. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the influence of actions on the consequences. Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on the analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is Neutral.

Relation: 1",Relation: 1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The harder they come, the harder they fall.",They will fall softly regardless of how hard they come at me.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""The harder they come, the harder they fall.""
- This statement suggests that the intensity or difficulty of an action (coming) is directly proportional to the intensity or difficulty of the consequence (falling).

Hypothesis: ""They will fall softly regardless of how hard they come at me.""
- This statement suggests that the consequence (falling) will be soft, no matter the intensity or difficulty of the action (coming).

Now, let's compare the two statements:
1. The Premise indicates a direct relationship between the intensity of coming and falling.
2. The Hypothesis indicates that the falling will be soft regardless of the intensity of coming.

These two statements are in direct opposition to each other. The Premise suggests a proportional relationship, while the Hypothesis suggests an inverse or non-existent relationship.

Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

The relation is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
comparative-correlative,partial,"The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.",He has a very annoying voice.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.""
   - This statement indicates that the presence of ""he"" causes increasing misery for the speaker over time.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He has a very annoying voice.""
   - This statement suggests that ""he"" possesses a specific characteristic, namely an annoying voice.

3. **Relation Analysis**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must directly imply that ""he"" has an annoying voice. The Premise does not provide specific information about why the speaker becomes more miserable, only that his presence causes misery. It could be due to various reasons, not necessarily his voice.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not specify the cause of the misery, so it is possible that his annoying voice is one of the reasons, but it is not certain.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to imply that ""he"" does not have an annoying voice. The Premise does not provide any information that contradicts the possibility of ""he"" having an annoying voice.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.","If he is around longer today, I will probably not enjoy myself.",0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.""
Hypothesis: ""If he is around longer today, I will probably not enjoy myself.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The premise states a direct relationship between the duration of someone's presence and the speaker's level of misery. Specifically, it implies that an increase in the duration of the person's presence leads to an increase in the speaker's misery.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The hypothesis suggests that if the person is around longer today, the speaker will probably not enjoy themselves. This implies a negative impact on the speaker's enjoyment due to the person's prolonged presence.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The premise indicates that the speaker's misery increases with the person's prolonged presence.
   - The hypothesis suggests that the speaker's enjoyment decreases (or they will not enjoy themselves) with the person's prolonged presence.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The hypothesis is consistent with the premise. If the speaker becomes more miserable with the person's prolonged presence, it logically follows that the speaker will not enjoy themselves if the person is around longer today.
   - The hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the premise. Instead, it aligns with the premise by expressing a probable outcome (not enjoying oneself) based on the premise's condition (the person's prolonged presence).

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.",I'm happiest on the days where he is around a lot.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.""
Hypothesis: ""I'm happiest on the days where he is around a lot.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The premise states that the speaker's misery increases with the duration of someone's presence. In other words, the more time this person spends around the speaker, the more miserable the speaker becomes.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The hypothesis claims that the speaker is happiest on the days when this person is around a lot. This implies that the speaker's happiness increases with the duration of this person's presence.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The premise indicates a direct relationship between the person's presence and the speaker's misery (more presence = more misery).
   - The hypothesis indicates a direct relationship between the person's presence and the speaker's happiness (more presence = more happiness).

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The premise and hypothesis present opposite relationships regarding the person's presence and the speaker's emotional state.
   - According to the premise, more presence leads to more misery, while according to the hypothesis, more presence leads to more happiness.

Given that the premise and hypothesis present contradictory emotional outcomes based on the same condition (the person's presence), the hypothesis cannot be true if the premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more I studied, the less I understood.",I studied a lot for my recent exams.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""The more I studied, the less I understood.""
Hypothesis: ""I studied a lot for my recent exams.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise suggests a negative correlation between studying and understanding. It implies that increased studying led to decreased understanding.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that the person studied a lot for their recent exams. It does not make any claim about the level of understanding achieved.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise does not directly state the amount of studying, but it implies that there was a significant amount of studying since it mentions ""the more I studied.""
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states that the person studied a lot.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be entailed by the Premise, the Premise must guarantee the truth of the Hypothesis. The Premise implies a significant amount of studying, which aligns with the Hypothesis stating ""I studied a lot."" Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.
   - **Neutral (1)**: This would be the case if the Premise did not provide enough information to determine the truth of the Hypothesis. However, the Premise does imply a significant amount of studying.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: This would be the case if the Premise directly opposed the Hypothesis. There is no contradiction here since both the Premise and Hypothesis suggest a significant amount of studying.

Given the analysis, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more I studied, the less I understood.",I got more confused as I studied.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

Premise: ""The more I studied, the less I understood.""
Hypothesis: ""I got more confused as I studied.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise states that as the amount of studying increased, the level of understanding decreased. This implies a negative correlation between studying and understanding.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis states that as the studying increased, the level of confusion increased. This implies a positive correlation between studying and confusion.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The premise indicates that increased studying leads to decreased understanding.
   - The hypothesis indicates that increased studying leads to increased confusion.

4. **Inference**:
   - If understanding decreases, it can be inferred that confusion might increase because understanding and confusion are often inversely related.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Relation: 0",Relation: 0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more I studied, the less I understood.",I felt like my studying helped me really grasp the subject.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: The more I studied, the less I understood.
Hypothesis: I felt like my studying helped me really grasp the subject.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that increased studying led to decreased understanding. This implies a negative correlation between studying and understanding.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that the studying helped in really grasping the subject. This implies a positive outcome from studying.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise suggests that studying did not help and actually made understanding worse.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that studying was beneficial and improved understanding.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis present opposite outcomes of studying.
   - If the Premise is true (studying led to less understanding), then the Hypothesis (studying helped grasp the subject) cannot be true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

comparative-correlative,partial,"It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.",This drug can be harmful for older patients.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.""
Hypothesis: ""This drug can be harmful for older patients.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The premise states that the effectiveness of the drug decreases as the age of the patient increases.
   - It does not mention anything about the drug being harmful, only that it becomes less effective.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The hypothesis suggests that the drug can be harmful for older patients.
   - This is a stronger claim than the premise, which only talks about reduced effectiveness, not harm.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The premise does not provide information about the drug being harmful; it only mentions reduced effectiveness.
   - The hypothesis introduces a new concept (harm) that is not supported or contradicted by the premise.

4. **Determining the Relation**:
   - Since the premise does not provide enough information to definitively state that the drug is harmful or not harmful, the hypothesis may or may not be true based on the given premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is Neutral.

   - ""It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.""
   - This statement suggests that the drug's effectiveness decreases as the patient's age increases.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""This drug is best suited for treating patients who are on the younger side.""
   - This statement suggests that the drug is more effective for younger patients.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the drug is less effective for older patients.
   - The Hypothesis states that the drug is best suited for younger patients, which aligns with the idea that it is less effective for older patients.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis logically follows. If the drug is less effective for older patients, it implies that it would be more effective for younger patients.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

comparative-correlative,partial,"It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.",Ideally patients that take this drug are advanced in age.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the given Premise and Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

### Premise:
""It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.""

### Hypothesis:
""Ideally patients that take this drug are advanced in age.""

### Analysis:
1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise suggests a negative correlation between the age of the patient and the effectiveness of the drug. Specifically, it implies that the drug is less effective for older patients.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that ideally, patients who take this drug are advanced in age. This implies a preference or ideal scenario where older patients are the ones taking the drug.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates that the drug is less effective for older patients.
   - The hypothesis suggests that it is ideal for older patients to take the drug.

### Conclusion:
- The premise and hypothesis are in direct conflict. The premise suggests that the drug is less effective for older patients, while the hypothesis suggests that it is ideal for older patients to take the drug. These two statements cannot both be true simultaneously.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Premise: ""Applied to health care, the longer we wait for it the worse off we are and the longer we put it off the longer it will take to fine tune it.""

Hypothesis: ""Waiting longer for healthcare will make it more expensive to implement.""

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The premise states that delaying healthcare has negative consequences: the longer we wait, the worse our situation becomes.
   - Additionally, it mentions that the longer we delay, the longer it will take to fine-tune healthcare.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis suggests that waiting longer for healthcare will increase the cost of implementing it.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The premise does not explicitly mention costs or expenses. It focuses on the worsening condition and the increased time required for fine-tuning.
   - The hypothesis introduces a new concept (increased cost) that is not directly addressed in the premise.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - Since the premise does not provide information about the cost of implementing healthcare, we cannot definitively conclude that waiting longer will make it more expensive.
   - The hypothesis is plausible but not directly supported or contradicted by the premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that delaying healthcare has negative consequences: ""the longer we wait for it the worse off we are"" and ""the longer we put it off the longer it will take to fine tune it.""
   - This implies that timely healthcare is important and that delaying it is detrimental.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Putting off adequate healthcare will not serve the people's best interests.""
   - This suggests that delaying healthcare is not beneficial for people.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise and the hypothesis both convey the idea that delaying healthcare is harmful or not beneficial.
   - The premise provides a detailed explanation of the negative consequences of delaying healthcare, while the hypothesis summarizes this idea by stating it is not in people's best interests.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given that the hypothesis is a direct conclusion that can be drawn from the premise, it is definitely true based on the information provided in the premise.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that delaying healthcare reforms has negative consequences: ""the longer we wait for it the worse off we are"" and ""the longer we put it off the longer it will take to fine tune it.""
   - This implies that prompt action is beneficial and delays are detrimental.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis suggests that it is probably best to keep delaying healthcare reforms: ""It's probably best to keep putting off applying healthcare reforms.""
   - This directly contradicts the premise, which argues against delays.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis cannot be true given the premise because the premise explicitly states that delays in healthcare reforms are harmful.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis is in direct contradiction to the premise.

### Hypothesis:
""Bureaucrats are always greedy.""

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Premise:**
   - The premise suggests a correlation between the number of bureaucrats running charities and the number of people who need those charities. It implies that an increase in bureaucratic involvement in charities leads to an increase in the number of people needing charity services.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis makes a general statement about bureaucrats, claiming that they are always greedy.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The premise does not make any direct statement about the personal characteristics or motivations of bureaucrats, such as greed.
   - The hypothesis introduces a new concept (greed) that is not mentioned or implied in the premise.

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - Since the premise does not provide any information about the greediness of bureaucrats, the hypothesis cannot be definitively concluded from the premise.
   - The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise, as the premise does not address the personal traits of bureaucrats.

Hypothesis: ""Bureaucrats are always greedy.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The Premise suggests a correlation between the number of bureaucrats running charities and the number of people who need those charities. It implies that an increase in bureaucrats running charities leads to an increase in people needing those charities.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis makes a general statement about the nature of bureaucrats, claiming that they are always greedy.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise does not make any direct statement about the greediness of bureaucrats. It only discusses the relationship between bureaucrats running charities and the number of people needing those charities.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new concept (greediness) that is not mentioned or implied in the Premise.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide any information about the greediness of bureaucrats, we cannot definitively say that the Hypothesis is true or false based on the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as the Premise does not address the characteristic of greediness.

comparative-correlative,partial,"The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.",Senior management is always micromanaging our decisions.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that the involvement of senior management increases with the expense of the decision. This implies a conditional relationship where senior management's involvement is dependent on the cost of the decision.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis claims that senior management is always micromanaging decisions. This suggests that senior management is involved in all decisions, regardless of their cost.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates a conditional involvement of senior management based on the expense of the decision.
   - The hypothesis suggests an unconditional and constant involvement of senior management in all decisions.

4. **Inference**:
   - The hypothesis contradicts the premise because the premise does not support the idea that senior management is involved in all decisions, only in more expensive ones.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the relation is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.",Senior management likes to oversee decisions that are most likely to cost a lot of money.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

Premise: ""The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.""
- This statement suggests a direct relationship between the cost of a decision and the involvement of senior management. Specifically, it implies that as the cost of a decision increases, the involvement of senior management also increases.

Hypothesis: ""Senior management likes to oversee decisions that are most likely to cost a lot of money.""
- This statement suggests that senior management has a preference for overseeing decisions that are expected to be expensive.

Now, let's determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis:

1. **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would be definitely true if the Premise directly supports it without any additional assumptions. In this case, the Premise does suggest that senior management is more involved in expensive decisions, but it does not explicitly state that they ""like"" to oversee these decisions. The Premise focuses on the correlation between cost and involvement, not on the preference or liking of senior management.

2. **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise indicates a correlation between decision cost and senior management involvement, but it does not provide information about senior management's preferences or likings. Therefore, the Hypothesis could be true, but it is not necessarily supported by the Premise alone.

3. **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would be false if the Premise directly contradicts it. In this case, there is no direct contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis. The Premise does not state anything that would make the Hypothesis impossible.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.",Senior management doesn't care much about the cost of potential decisions.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step:

Premise: ""The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.""
- This statement suggests a direct relationship between the cost of a decision and the involvement of senior management. Specifically, it implies that as the cost of a decision increases, senior management's involvement also increases.

Hypothesis: ""Senior management doesn't care much about the cost of potential decisions.""
- This statement suggests that senior management is indifferent to the cost of decisions, implying that their involvement is not influenced by the cost.

Now, let's determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis:

1. **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, it must be definitely true given the Premise. However, the Premise indicates that senior management's involvement increases with the cost of decisions, which directly contradicts the Hypothesis that senior management doesn't care about the cost.

2. **Neutral (1)**: For the Hypothesis to be neutral, it must be possible but not necessarily true given the Premise. However, the Premise and the Hypothesis are in direct opposition, making it impossible for the Hypothesis to be true given the Premise.

3. **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, it must be impossible for it to be true given the Premise. Since the Premise states that senior management's involvement increases with the cost of decisions, and the Hypothesis states that senior management doesn't care about the cost, these two statements are directly contradictory.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

comparative-correlative,partial,"Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.",The game will be fun.,1,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.""
Hypothesis: ""The game will be fun.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise is stating that completing a task quickly will allow them to start the game sooner. It does not provide any information about the nature or quality of the game itself.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis is making a claim about the game being fun.

3. **Checking for Entailment**: For the hypothesis to be an entailment, the premise must provide definitive information that the game will be fun. The premise does not mention anything about the game's enjoyment or fun factor.

4. **Checking for Contradiction**: For the hypothesis to be a contradiction, the premise must provide information that directly negates the hypothesis. The premise does not provide any information that the game will not be fun.

5. **Checking for Neutral**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise does not provide enough information to determine whether the game will be fun or not.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral

Therefore, the relation is:

comparative-correlative,partial,"Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.",We have to do this before the game can start.,0,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.""
Hypothesis: ""We have to do this before the game can start.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The Premise suggests that there is an activity (""this"") that needs to be completed quickly in order to proceed with the game.
   - The phrase ""the faster we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game"" implies that completing ""this"" is a prerequisite for continuing with the game.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that ""We have to do this before the game can start.""
   - This implies that ""this"" is a necessary condition that must be fulfilled before the game can begin.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise indicates that completing ""this"" allows the game to proceed, which aligns with the Hypothesis that ""this"" must be done before the game can start.
   - Both statements suggest that ""this"" is a prerequisite for the game, though the Premise focuses on the speed of completion affecting the start time, while the Hypothesis simply states the necessity of completion.

4. **Determining the Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise because the Premise implies that ""this"" must be done to proceed with the game, which is consistent with the Hypothesis stating that ""this"" must be done before the game can start.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.",We don't have to do this before the game starts.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.""
Hypothesis: ""We don't have to do this before the game starts.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**:
   - The Premise suggests that there is an activity (""this"") that needs to be completed before the game can proceed.
   - It implies a sequence: first, complete ""this"" activity, then proceed with the game.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that it is not necessary to complete ""this"" activity before the game starts.
   - This directly contradicts the implication in the Premise that ""this"" activity must be done before the game can proceed.

3. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The Premise implies a necessity to complete an activity before the game.
   - The Hypothesis denies this necessity.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.""
   - This statement suggests that an increase in snow leads to a decrease in danger for skiers.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""More snow makes skiers go faster down the slopes.""
   - This statement suggests that an increase in snow causes skiers to go faster.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about the relationship between snow and danger, implying that more snow reduces danger.
   - The Hypothesis talks about the relationship between snow and speed, implying that more snow increases speed.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis discuss different outcomes of increased snow (danger vs. speed).
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the speed of skiers, only about their safety.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise, as the Premise does not address the speed of skiers.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

   - ""The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.""
   - This statement suggests that an increase in snowfall correlates with a decrease in danger for skiers.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""It's most safe to ski if there has been a substantial snowfall recently.""
   - This statement suggests that skiing is safest when there has been a significant amount of recent snowfall.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a direct relationship between more snow and less danger.
   - The Hypothesis states that substantial snowfall makes skiing the safest.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise. If more snow leads to less danger, then substantial snowfall (which implies a lot of snow) would indeed make skiing safer.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

   - ""The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.""
   - This statement suggests that an increase in snow leads to a decrease in danger for skiers.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""It is too dangerous to ski on days when there was heavy snow recently.""
   - This statement suggests that heavy snow makes skiing too dangerous.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that more snow reduces danger.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that heavy snow increases danger.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. According to the Premise, more snow should make skiing safer, not more dangerous.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the relation is:

comparative-correlative,partial,"The more they work, the more I will pay them.",My workers always work very hard.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more they work, the more I will pay them.""
   - This statement indicates a conditional relationship between the amount of work done and the payment received. It does not provide any information about the actual amount of work being done by the workers.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""My workers always work very hard.""
   - This statement asserts that the workers consistently put in a lot of effort.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the actual work habits of the workers; it only states a conditional relationship between work and payment.
   - The Hypothesis makes a definitive claim about the workers' behavior, which is not addressed or implied by the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide enough information to determine whether the workers always work very hard or not, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Premise: The more they work, the more I will pay them.
Hypothesis: I intend to compensate my workers based on their amount of work.

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise states that there is a direct relationship between the amount of work done and the payment received. Specifically, it implies that increased work will result in increased payment.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The hypothesis states that the speaker intends to compensate workers based on the amount of work they do. This means that the payment is directly related to the amount of work.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The premise explicitly states a conditional relationship between work and payment.
   - The hypothesis expresses an intention to compensate based on the amount of work, which aligns with the conditional relationship stated in the premise.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The hypothesis is a restatement of the premise in different words. Both convey the same idea that payment is proportional to the amount of work done.
   - There is no additional information in the hypothesis that contradicts or goes beyond what is stated in the premise.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more they work, the more I will pay them.",I never pay my workers.,2,"Let's analyze the given Premise and Hypothesis step by step to determine the inference relation.

Premise: ""The more they work, the more I will pay them.""
Hypothesis: ""I never pay my workers.""

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The Premise states that there is a direct relationship between the amount of work done and the payment given. Specifically, it implies that payment is given and increases with the amount of work.

2. **Understanding the Hypothesis**: The Hypothesis states that the speaker never pays their workers, which means no payment is given regardless of the amount of work done.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise indicates that payment is given and is proportional to the work done.
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that no payment is given at all.

4. **Determining the Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis states something that is directly opposite to what the Premise implies, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.
