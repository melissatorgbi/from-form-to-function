let-alone,substantive,"A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.",There will be peaceful negotiation of a ceasefire.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.""
   - This implies that achieving a ceasefire or lasting peace requires extensive negotiation.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""There will be peaceful negotiation of a ceasefire.""
   - This suggests that the negotiation process for a ceasefire will be peaceful.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise emphasizes the duration and difficulty of the negotiation process but does not specify whether the negotiation will be peaceful or not.
   - The hypothesis specifically mentions that the negotiation will be peaceful, which is an additional detail not covered by the premise.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The premise does not provide enough information to confirm that the negotiation will be peaceful. It only states that the negotiation will be long.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis introduces a new element (peaceful negotiation) that is not directly supported or contradicted by the premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Thus, the final answer is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.",Negotiating lasting peace will take less time than negotiating a ceasefire.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.""
   - This implies that negotiating a ceasefire will take a long time, and negotiating lasting peace will take even longer.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Negotiating lasting peace will take less time than negotiating a ceasefire.""
   - This implies that the time required to negotiate lasting peace is shorter than the time required to negotiate a ceasefire.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise suggests that lasting peace negotiations will take longer than ceasefire negotiations.
   - The hypothesis suggests the opposite: that lasting peace negotiations will take less time than ceasefire negotiations.

4. **Inference**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. According to the premise, lasting peace takes longer to negotiate than a ceasefire, while the hypothesis claims the opposite.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.","It will take long negotiation to achieve a ceasefire, and even longer negotiation to achieve lasting peace.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""A ceasefire, let alone lasting peace, will take long negotiation.""
   - This means that achieving a ceasefire requires long negotiation, and achieving lasting peace would require even more negotiation.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""It will take long negotiation to achieve a ceasefire, and even longer negotiation to achieve lasting peace.""
   - This means that achieving a ceasefire requires long negotiation, and achieving lasting peace requires even longer negotiation.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis convey the same idea: achieving a ceasefire requires long negotiation, and achieving lasting peace requires even more negotiation.
   - The hypothesis rephrases the premise but does not introduce any new information or contradict the premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the hypothesis is a restatement of the premise and does not contradict it, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.,Both individuals and society will be consistent after difficulty.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.""
   - This suggests that achieving consistency is challenging for an individual and even more so for a society.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Both individuals and society will be consistent after difficulty.""
   - This implies that despite the difficulty, both individuals and society will eventually achieve consistency.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise emphasizes the difficulty of achieving consistency for both individuals and society, without suggesting that they will eventually achieve it.
   - The hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that consistency will be achieved after overcoming the difficulty.

4. **Inference**:
   - The hypothesis makes a definitive claim about the outcome (achieving consistency) that is not supported by the premise.
   - The premise only highlights the difficulty and does not provide any information about the eventual achievement of consistency.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis cannot be true based on the information provided in the premise. The premise does not support the idea that consistency will be achieved, only that it is difficult to achieve.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.,It is easier for a society to be consistent than an individual.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.""
   - This implies that being consistent is challenging for an individual, and it suggests that it is even more challenging for a society.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""It is easier for a society to be consistent than an individual.""
   - This implies that being consistent is less challenging for a society compared to an individual.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise suggests that consistency is more difficult for a society than for an individual.
   - The hypothesis suggests the opposite, that consistency is easier for a society than for an individual.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The premise and the hypothesis present directly opposing views on the difficulty of consistency for an individual versus a society.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.,It is easier for an individual to be consistent than a society.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""It is difficult enough for an individual to be consistent let alone a society.""
   - This implies that being consistent is challenging for an individual, and it suggests that it is even more challenging for a society.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""It is easier for an individual to be consistent than a society.""
   - This suggests that being consistent is easier for an individual compared to a society.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates that consistency is difficult for both individuals and societies, with an implication that it is more difficult for a society.
   - The hypothesis directly states that it is easier for an individual to be consistent than a society.

4. **Inference**:
   - The hypothesis aligns with the implication of the premise. The premise suggests that if consistency is difficult for an individual, it is even more difficult for a society, which aligns with the hypothesis stating that it is easier for an individual to be consistent than a society.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,"I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.","I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl living in Ohio.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading ""it.""
   - The speaker would be even more distressed if a girl of tender years and experience were reading ""it.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The speaker would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading ""it.""
   - The speaker would be even more distressed if a girl living in Ohio were reading ""it.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis share the same initial clause: ""I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it.""
   - The difference lies in the specific description of the girl:
     - Premise: ""a girl of your tender years and experience.""
     - Hypothesis: ""a girl living in Ohio.""

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not specify the location of the girl, only her age and experience.
   - The Hypothesis specifies the location (Ohio) but does not mention age or experience.
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise because it is possible for a girl living in Ohio to also be of tender years and experience.
   - However, the Hypothesis introduces new information (location) that is not present in the Premise, making it uncertain whether the girl in the Hypothesis matches the description in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.","I would like to hear of ladies reading anything they like, no matter the age of them.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker expresses distress at the idea of any ladies reading ""it.""
   - The speaker is particularly concerned about a young girl reading ""it,"" given her tender years and experience.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The speaker expresses a positive attitude towards ladies reading anything they like.
   - The speaker does not place any restrictions based on age.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise shows a negative reaction to ladies, especially young girls, reading a particular material.
   - The Hypothesis shows a positive and unrestricted attitude towards ladies reading anything, regardless of age.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis present opposing views.
   - The Premise indicates distress and concern, while the Hypothesis indicates approval and freedom.
   - These views cannot coexist; if the Premise is true, the Hypothesis cannot be true, and vice versa.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

let-alone,substantive,"I would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading it, let alone a girl of your tender years and experience.",I would be distressed to hear of a girl of your tender years and experience reading it.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker would be distressed to hear of any ladies reading ""it"".
   - The speaker would be even more distressed to hear of a girl of ""your tender years and experience"" reading ""it"".

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The speaker would be distressed to hear of a girl of ""your tender years and experience"" reading ""it"".

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis is a specific case of the Premise. The Premise states a general distress about any ladies reading ""it"" and specifically mentions greater distress for a girl of ""your tender years and experience"".
   - The Hypothesis focuses only on the specific case of a girl of ""your tender years and experience"" reading ""it"".

4. **Inference**:
   - If the Premise is true (the speaker would be distressed about any ladies and especially a young girl reading ""it""), then it logically follows that the speaker would indeed be distressed about a girl of ""your tender years and experience"" reading ""it"".
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

let-alone,substantive,"None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.",The arguments are not presented in a convincing order.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.""
   - This means that the arguments mentioned are weak and not definitive.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""The arguments are not presented in a convincing order.""
   - This implies that the order in which the arguments are presented is not persuasive.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise focuses on the strength and conclusiveness of the arguments themselves, indicating that they are weak and not conclusive.
   - The hypothesis, on the other hand, focuses on the order of presentation of the arguments, suggesting that the order is not convincing.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The premise does not provide any information about the order of the arguments. It only comments on the strength and conclusiveness of the arguments.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis about the order of presentation may or may not be true based on the given premise. The premise does not give enough information to definitively confirm or deny the hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.",All of the given arguments are strong and conclusive.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.""
   - This means that not a single argument among the given ones is strong, and they are far from being conclusive.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""All of the given arguments are strong and conclusive.""
   - This means that every argument among the given ones is both strong and conclusive.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise asserts that none of the arguments are strong or conclusive.
   - The hypothesis asserts the exact opposite, that all of the arguments are strong and conclusive.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, it is impossible for both statements to be true simultaneously.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

The correct numerical value is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.",None of these arguments is conclusive.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive.""
   - This means that none of the arguments are strong, and they are certainly not conclusive.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""None of these arguments is conclusive.""
   - This means that none of the arguments reach a conclusive level.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides more information than the Hypothesis. It not only states that the arguments are not conclusive but also that they are not notably strong.
   - The Hypothesis is a subset of the information provided in the Premise. Specifically, if none of the arguments are notably strong, it logically follows that none of them are conclusive.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given that the Premise includes the information that none of the arguments are conclusive, the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment

The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

let-alone,substantive,"Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.",Ambiguous promises given are not to be happily accepted.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that vague promises are not grounds for satisfaction or complacency.
   - This implies that vague promises should not lead to a feeling of contentment or self-satisfaction.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that ambiguous promises given are not to be happily accepted.
   - This implies that ambiguous promises should not be accepted with happiness or contentment.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis discuss the nature of vague or ambiguous promises.
   - The premise suggests that such promises do not justify satisfaction or complacency.
   - The hypothesis suggests that such promises should not be accepted happily.

4. **Inference**:
   - The premise and the hypothesis are essentially conveying the same idea: vague or ambiguous promises should not lead to positive feelings (satisfaction, complacency, or happiness).
   - The hypothesis is a rephrasing of the premise's idea in a slightly different manner but does not introduce any new information or contradict the premise.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,"Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.",The speaker is more complacent than satisfied when hearing vague promises.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.""
   - This means that vague promises do not provide any reason for satisfaction, and even less so for complacency. In other words, the speaker finds vague promises insufficient for feeling satisfied and even more insufficient for feeling complacent.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""The speaker is more complacent than satisfied when hearing vague promises.""
   - This suggests that the speaker feels a higher degree of complacency than satisfaction when hearing vague promises.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise clearly indicates that vague promises do not lead to satisfaction and even less to complacency. This implies that the speaker feels neither satisfied nor complacent, with complacency being even less likely than satisfaction.
   - The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests a comparison where complacency is greater than satisfaction, which directly contradicts the premise.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - Given that the premise states that vague promises are not grounds for satisfaction and even less for complacency, the hypothesis suggesting that the speaker is more complacent than satisfied is directly opposed to the information provided in the premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.",The promises given are vague and the speaker will not be satisfied nor complacent.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information provided in both statements and analyze their relationship step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - The premise states: ""Even so, such vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction, let alone complacency.""
   - Key points:
     - The promises are described as ""vague.""
     - These vague promises do not provide a basis for ""satisfaction.""
     - These vague promises do not provide a basis for ""complacency.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - The hypothesis states: ""The promises given are vague and the speaker will not be satisfied nor complacent.""
   - Key points:
     - The promises are described as ""vague.""
     - The speaker will not be ""satisfied.""
     - The speaker will not be ""complacent.""

3. **Comparison:**
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis agree that the promises are ""vague.""
   - The premise explicitly states that these vague promises are no grounds for satisfaction or complacency.
   - The hypothesis states that the speaker will not be satisfied nor complacent, which aligns with the premise's assertion that vague promises do not provide grounds for satisfaction or complacency.

### Conclusion:
- The hypothesis is directly supported by the premise. The premise provides a clear basis for the hypothesis, making the hypothesis definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment",0 – Entailment,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,"Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.",Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to adequately tax the aging population who would be retiring in the near future.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that Mr. Brown claimed the Government had failed to address current failures and future challenges.
   - This is a broad statement about the Government's overall performance and its inability to handle both present and future issues.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that Mr. Brown claimed the Government had failed to adequately tax the aging population who would be retiring in the near future.
   - This is a specific claim about a particular issue (taxing the aging population) that could be considered a part of the broader challenges mentioned in the Premise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not provide specific details about the types of failures or challenges the Government is facing.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a specific issue (taxing the aging population) that is not explicitly mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be entailed by the Premise, the Premise would need to specifically mention the issue of taxing the aging population. Since the Premise only talks about general failures and challenges, it does not entail the specific claim in the Hypothesis.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, as the specific issue of taxing the aging population could be one of the failures or challenges the Government is facing. However, the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny this specific claim.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: There is no information in the Premise that directly contradicts the Hypothesis. The Premise is broad and does not rule out the possibility that the Government failed in the specific way mentioned in the Hypothesis.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,"Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.",The Government always owns up to failures committed by them throughout the years and everyone else agrees.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.""
   - This implies that, according to Mr. Brown, the Government is not addressing current failures and is even less prepared to handle future challenges.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that ""The Government always owns up to failures committed by them throughout the years and everyone else agrees.""
   - This implies that the Government consistently acknowledges its failures and that this acknowledgment is universally accepted.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise suggests that the Government is not addressing its current failures, which implies a lack of acknowledgment or action regarding these failures.
   - The Hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the Government always acknowledges its failures and that this acknowledgment is accepted by everyone.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis present opposing views about the Government's behavior regarding its failures.
   - The Premise indicates a failure to address or acknowledge failures, while the Hypothesis indicates consistent acknowledgment and acceptance of failures.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the information provided in the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,"Mr Brown claimed that the Government had failed to face the failures of the present, let alone the challenges of the future.",Mr. Brown stated that the Government is not prepared to face the challenges of the future.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the content step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that Mr. Brown claimed the Government had failed to face the failures of the present.
   - Additionally, it mentions that the Government had also failed to face the challenges of the future.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that Mr. Brown stated the Government is not prepared to face the challenges of the future.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly mentions that Mr. Brown claimed the Government had failed to face the challenges of the future.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases this by stating that Mr. Brown said the Government is not prepared to face the challenges of the future.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a restatement of part of the Premise. Specifically, it focuses on the part where Mr. Brown claimed the Government had failed to face the challenges of the future.
   - Since the Hypothesis is directly supported by the information given in the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
let-alone,substantive,There must have been text books around at one time but I can not even identify any titles let alone suppliers.,The speaker does not often read text books if they cannot identify any.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - The speaker mentions that there must have been textbooks around at one time.
   - The speaker states that they cannot identify any titles of these textbooks.
   - The speaker also mentions that they cannot identify any suppliers of these textbooks.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - The hypothesis suggests that the speaker does not often read textbooks.
   - This suggestion is based on the fact that the speaker cannot identify any textbooks.

3. **Inference Evaluation:**
   - **Entailment (0):** For the hypothesis to be definitely true given the premise, the premise must provide clear evidence that the speaker does not often read textbooks. The premise does not explicitly state the speaker's reading habits; it only mentions the speaker's inability to identify textbooks or suppliers.
   - **Neutral (1):** The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude the speaker's reading habits. The speaker's inability to identify textbooks could be due to various reasons unrelated to their reading frequency.
   - **Contradiction (2):** For the hypothesis to be false given the premise, the premise would need to provide evidence that the speaker does often read textbooks. The premise does not provide such evidence; it only mentions the speaker's inability to identify textbooks or suppliers.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is Neutral (1) because the premise does not provide enough information to definitively determine the speaker's reading habits.

**Answer: 1**",**Answer: 1**,False,True,False,1
let-alone,substantive,There must have been text books around at one time but I can not even identify any titles let alone suppliers.,"The speaker knows a lot about text books, including their titles and where they might come from.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker acknowledges that text books existed at some point (""There must have been text books around at one time"").
   - The speaker admits to not being able to identify any titles of these text books (""I can not even identify any titles"").
   - The speaker also admits to not knowing any suppliers of these text books (""let alone suppliers"").

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis claims that the speaker knows a lot about text books.
   - It specifically states that the speaker knows the titles of the text books and where they might come from.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise clearly states that the speaker cannot identify any titles of the text books.
   - The premise also states that the speaker does not know any suppliers of the text books.
   - The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims the opposite: that the speaker knows a lot about text books, including their titles and suppliers.

4. **Inference**:
   - Given the premise, the hypothesis cannot be true because the premise explicitly states the speaker's lack of knowledge about text books, their titles, and suppliers.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis directly contradicts the information provided in the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
let-alone,substantive,There must have been text books around at one time but I can not even identify any titles let alone suppliers.,"The speaker can deduce textbooks exist, but cannot identify any titles or thier suppliers.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each part step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""There must have been text books around at one time"": This suggests that the speaker believes textbooks existed in the past.
   - ""but I can not even identify any titles let alone suppliers"": This indicates that the speaker cannot identify any specific titles or suppliers of these textbooks.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The speaker can deduce textbooks exist"": This aligns with the first part of the premise where the speaker believes textbooks existed.
   - ""but cannot identify any titles or their suppliers"": This matches the second part of the premise where the speaker cannot identify any specific titles or suppliers.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis accurately reflects the information given in the Premise. Both parts of the Hypothesis are directly supported by the corresponding parts of the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the information provided in the Premise, the correct relation is:

0 – Entailment

Therefore, the relation is:

let-alone,substantive,"Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.",I have friends who have been to other countries outside Australia.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.""
   - This means that the majority of the speaker's friends have not traveled outside of Australia. The phrase ""let alone been all over the world"" emphasizes that not only have they not traveled internationally, but they certainly haven't traveled extensively.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""I have friends who have been to other countries outside Australia.""
   - This means that the speaker claims to have friends who have traveled internationally, outside of Australia.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates that ""most"" friends haven't been outside Australia, but it does not state that ""all"" friends haven't been outside Australia. The use of ""most"" implies that there could be some friends who have traveled internationally.
   - The hypothesis claims that there are friends who have been to other countries outside Australia, which is not ruled out by the premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the premise allows for the possibility that some friends might have traveled outside Australia (even though most have not), the hypothesis could be true.
   - The hypothesis is not definitely true based on the premise, but it is also not contradicted by the premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Final answer:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.""
   - This means that the majority of the speaker's friends have not traveled outside of Australia. It implies that very few, if any, of the speaker's friends have traveled internationally.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""I only have friends who have been to countries outside Australia.""
   - This means that all of the speaker's friends have traveled internationally, i.e., they have been to countries outside of Australia.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates that most of the speaker's friends have not been outside Australia.
   - The hypothesis claims that all of the speaker's friends have been to countries outside Australia.

4. **Inference**:
   - If most of the speaker's friends have not been outside Australia, it directly contradicts the hypothesis that all of the speaker's friends have been to countries outside Australia.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

let-alone,substantive,"Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.","I have a lot of friends who haven't traveled around the world, or even been outside Australia.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Most of my friends haven't been outside Australia, let alone been all over the world.""
   - This means that the majority of the speaker's friends have not traveled outside of Australia, and even fewer (if any) have traveled extensively around the world.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I have a lot of friends who haven't traveled around the world, or even been outside Australia.""
   - This means that the speaker has many friends who have not traveled extensively around the world, and some of these friends have not even been outside Australia.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey similar information about the travel experiences of the speaker's friends.
   - The Premise states that most friends haven't been outside Australia, implying that they also haven't traveled around the world.
   - The Hypothesis states that many friends haven't traveled around the world and some haven't been outside Australia, which aligns with the information given in the Premise.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with slightly different wording but conveys the same core idea.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because it does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

way-manner,partial,"As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.",She was moving forward when a knight on horseback almost ran her over.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""As she felt her way forward"": This indicates that she was moving forward, possibly in a cautious or uncertain manner.
   - ""suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her"": This describes an event where a knight on horseback quickly moved past her.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She was moving forward"": This is consistent with the premise where she was feeling her way forward.
   - ""when a knight on horseback almost ran her over"": This suggests that the knight on horseback came very close to hitting her.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that she was moving forward.
   - The Premise states that the knight galloped past her, which implies a close encounter but does not explicitly state the degree of proximity.
   - The Hypothesis adds the detail that the knight ""almost ran her over,"" which is a stronger implication of proximity but not necessarily contradictory to the Premise.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis is not definitely true based on the Premise alone because the Premise does not specify how close the knight came to her.
   - The Hypothesis is not definitely false either, as the Premise allows for the possibility that the knight came very close to her.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,"As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.","As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback stopped to help her along.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.""
   - Key points:
     - The subject (""she"") is moving forward.
     - A knight on horseback is involved.
     - The knight gallops past her, indicating rapid movement away from her.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback stopped to help her along.""
   - Key points:
     - The subject (""she"") is moving forward.
     - A knight on horseback is involved.
     - The knight stops to help her, indicating a halt in movement and an intention to assist.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis agree that the subject is moving forward and that a knight on horseback is present.
   - However, the actions of the knight differ significantly:
     - In the premise, the knight gallops past her, which implies moving quickly away from her.
     - In the hypothesis, the knight stops to help her, which implies stopping and providing assistance.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The actions of the knight in the premise (galloping past) and the hypothesis (stopping to help) are contradictory.
   - If the knight gallops past her, he cannot simultaneously stop to help her.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

way-manner,partial,"As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.","As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback went past her.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""As she felt her way forward, suddenly a knight on horseback galloped past her.""
   - Key points:
     - The subject is ""she.""
     - She is moving forward, specifically ""felt her way forward,"" which implies she is moving cautiously or with difficulty.
     - A knight on horseback ""galloped"" past her, indicating a fast movement.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""As she was moving forward, a knight on horseback went past her.""
   - Key points:
     - The subject is ""she.""
     - She is moving forward.
     - A knight on horseback ""went"" past her, which is a more general term for movement compared to ""galloped.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same subject (""she"") moving forward.
   - Both mention a knight on horseback passing her.
   - The main difference is the description of her movement (""felt her way forward"" vs. ""was moving forward"") and the knight's movement (""galloped"" vs. ""went"").

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis simplifies the Premise by using more general terms.
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it is a less detailed version of the same event.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because it does not introduce any new information that would make it false.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

way-manner,partial,If you type in the following program exactly as listed and run it you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.,A snake-like pattern might appear on your screen when you run a specific program into your personal computer.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that if you type in a specific program exactly as listed and run it, you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.
   - This implies a certainty that the pattern will appear if the conditions (typing the program exactly as listed and running it) are met.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis suggests that a snake-like pattern might appear on your screen when you run a specific program on your personal computer.
   - The use of ""might"" indicates a possibility rather than a certainty.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise guarantees the appearance of the pattern if the program is typed and run exactly as listed.
   - The hypothesis, however, only suggests a possibility (""might appear"") rather than a certainty.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis is less certain than the premise. The premise provides a definite outcome, while the hypothesis only suggests a possible outcome.
   - Since the hypothesis does not contradict the premise but rather presents a less certain version of it, it is not a contradiction.
   - The hypothesis is not definitely true given the premise because the hypothesis introduces uncertainty (""might"").

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that if you type in a specific program exactly as listed and run it, you will see a fascinating pattern that resembles a snake on your screen.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis claims that nothing shows up on your computer when you run this specific program, and specifically, nothing that resembles a snake.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise asserts that running the program will result in a visible pattern resembling a snake.
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that nothing will show up, and certainly not a snake-like pattern.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the outcome described in the Premise, it cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that if you type in a specific program exactly as listed and run it, you will see a fascinating pattern snake its way across your screen.
   - Key points: 
     - The program must be typed exactly as listed.
     - The program must be run.
     - The result is a fascinating pattern that resembles a snake.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis suggests that there's a cool snake pattern that could appear on your screen when you follow the given program and run it exactly right.
   - Key points:
     - The program must be followed and run exactly right.
     - The result is a cool snake pattern.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis talk about running a program exactly as given.
   - Both mention the result as a snake pattern appearing on the screen.
   - The Premise uses ""fascinating pattern snake its way"" while the Hypothesis uses ""cool snake pattern."" These descriptions are essentially synonymous in this context.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with slightly different wording but the same meaning.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise describes a situation where a miner could slip from worn and greasy rungs, potentially falling a long way.
   - It also mentions that a dropped tool could fall and cause death or injury to someone below.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that a miner has tools that are valuable and costly to replace if dropped from high above while climbing.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise does not provide any information about the value or cost of the tools. It only mentions the potential danger of a dropped tool causing injury or death.
   - The hypothesis introduces new information about the tools being valuable and costly, which is not addressed in the premise.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - Since the premise does not provide any information about the value or cost of the tools, we cannot definitively conclude that the tools are valuable and costly based on the given premise.
   - The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise, as the premise does not contradict the hypothesis but also does not support it with the necessary information.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - The premise describes a scenario where a miner who slips from worn and greasy rungs of a ladder is at risk of falling a long way.
   - It also mentions that a dropped tool could fall and potentially cause death or injury to someone below.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - The hypothesis states that a miner does not usually have tools that could ever cause injury to others, even if they were climbing high above someone below and slipped on a ladder.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The premise explicitly states that a dropped tool could cause death or injury to someone below.
   - The hypothesis contradicts this by asserting that miners do not usually have tools that could cause injury to others.

4. **Inference Determination:**
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the premise. The premise indicates that tools can indeed cause injury, while the hypothesis denies this possibility.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise describes a situation where a miner who slips from worn and greasy rungs is likely to fall a long way.
   - It also mentions that a dropped tool could fall and potentially cause death or injury to someone below.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that a miner could cause death or injury to an unsuspecting person below them if they were to slip from worn-out rungs and fall or drop a tool.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis discuss the potential danger of a miner slipping from worn rungs and the possibility of causing harm to someone below.
   - The hypothesis rephrases the premise but maintains the same core idea: the risk of death or injury due to a fall or a dropped tool.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the premise.
   - It also does not leave room for doubt about the possibility of the described events occurring, as it directly aligns with the scenario presented in the premise.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise. Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

way-manner,partial,"She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.","She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension at their suggestion that she go out without a coat.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.""
   - This sentence describes a woman who is feeling apprehensive, but it does not specify the reason for her apprehension.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension at their suggestion that she go out without a coat.""
   - This sentence also describes a woman feeling apprehensive, but it provides a specific reason for her apprehension: a suggestion that she go out without a coat.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise and the hypothesis both describe a woman feeling apprehensive while staring from one person to another.
   - The key difference is that the hypothesis provides a specific reason for the apprehension (the suggestion to go out without a coat), while the premise does not specify any reason.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be an entailment, the premise must provide enough information to make the hypothesis definitely true. Since the premise does not specify the reason for the apprehension, we cannot be certain that the apprehension is due to the suggestion to go out without a coat.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise does not contradict the hypothesis, but it also does not provide enough information to confirm it. The reason for the apprehension in the hypothesis is plausible but not confirmed by the premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the hypothesis to be a contradiction, the premise must provide information that makes the hypothesis definitely false. Since the premise does not specify any reason for the apprehension, it does not contradict the hypothesis.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

way-manner,partial,"She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.","Staring from one to the other, the girl felt only confidence and strength in her body.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The subject is ""She.""
   - The action is ""stared from one to the other.""
   - The emotional state described is ""feeling apprehension.""
   - The physical reaction to the emotion is ""shiver its cold way along her spine.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The subject is ""the girl,"" which can be inferred to be the same as ""She"" in the premise.
   - The action is ""staring from one to the other,"" which matches the action in the premise.
   - The emotional state described is ""felt only confidence and strength.""
   - The physical reaction to the emotion is implied to be positive, as it mentions ""confidence and strength in her body.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes the girl feeling ""apprehension"" and a physical reaction of a ""shiver"" along her spine, which indicates fear or nervousness.
   - The Hypothesis describes the girl feeling ""only confidence and strength,"" which is a direct contrast to the feeling of apprehension.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The emotional states described in the Premise and Hypothesis are directly opposite. Apprehension (fear/nervousness) is not compatible with confidence and strength.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true because the emotional states are contradictory.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

way-manner,partial,"She stared from one to the other, feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine.",She felt apprehension course through her body as she stared from one to the other.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""She stared from one to the other"" indicates that the subject is looking back and forth between two entities.
   - ""feeling apprehension shiver its cold way along her spine"" describes the physical sensation of apprehension, specifically noting that it is felt along her spine.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""She felt apprehension course through her body"" suggests that the subject is experiencing apprehension throughout her body.
   - ""as she stared from one to the other"" repeats the action of looking back and forth between two entities.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the subject feeling apprehension while looking from one entity to another.
   - The Premise specifies that the apprehension is felt along her spine, while the Hypothesis generalizes this to the entire body.

4. **Inference Determination:**
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it is a broader description of the same feeling of apprehension.
   - The Hypothesis can be considered true given the Premise because feeling apprehension along the spine can be seen as a specific instance of feeling apprehension throughout the body.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that ""We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.""
   - Key points: 
     - The songs were picked from tapes.
     - The action of singing occurred across Europe.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that ""We picked out all of the best songs from our favorite German operas and sang our way across the rest of Europe.""
   - Key points:
     - The songs were picked from German operas.
     - The action of singing occurred across Europe.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis mention picking out the best songs and singing across Europe.
   - The difference lies in the source of the songs:
     - Premise: Songs were picked from tapes.
     - Hypothesis: Songs were picked from German operas.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The source of the songs is different in the premise and the hypothesis.
   - The hypothesis specifies ""German operas,"" which is a more specific source compared to the general ""tapes"" mentioned in the premise.
   - The hypothesis does not contradict the premise because it is possible that the tapes could contain songs from German operas, but this is not explicitly stated in the premise.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.""
   - This implies that the subjects were actively engaged in singing while traveling across Europe. The activity of singing suggests a lively and possibly enjoyable atmosphere during the travel.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""We sat in uncomfortable silence as we travelled across the rest of Europe.""
   - This implies that the subjects were not engaging in any conversation or activity and were experiencing discomfort during the travel. The atmosphere is described as silent and uncomfortable.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise describes an active and enjoyable activity (singing) during travel.
   - The hypothesis describes a passive and uncomfortable state (sitting in silence) during travel.
   - These two descriptions are mutually exclusive. If the subjects were singing and enjoying themselves, they could not simultaneously be sitting in uncomfortable silence.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, it is impossible for both statements to be true at the same time.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:

way-manner,partial,We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.,We had tapes playing the best picked songs we sang to across our trip of Europe.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""We picked out all of the best songs from the tapes and sang our way across the rest of Europe.""
   - This means that a selection of the best songs was made from tapes, and these songs were sung while traveling across Europe.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""We had tapes playing the best picked songs we sang to across our trip of Europe.""
   - This suggests that there were tapes playing the best-picked songs during the trip across Europe.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis involve the best songs from tapes and a trip across Europe.
   - The Premise explicitly states that the songs were sung during the trip.
   - The Hypothesis implies that the tapes were playing these songs during the trip, which can be interpreted as the songs being sung along to the tapes.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it is consistent with the idea that the best songs were played and sung during the trip.
   - The Hypothesis can be seen as a rephrasing or a slightly different perspective of the same scenario described in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise describes a specific woman who is big and bosomy.
   - This woman has a habit of keeping a box of biscuits on her desk while she works.
   - It is mentioned that Sarella can hear her crunching through the biscuits.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis makes a general statement about ""big, bosomy women"" loving to eat a box of biscuits near them at work.
   - It also mentions that coworkers can hear them crunching the whole time.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise provides information about a specific individual, not a generalization about all big, bosomy women.
   - The hypothesis generalizes the behavior of one specific woman to all big, bosomy women.
   - The premise does not provide enough information to support the generalization made in the hypothesis.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise only describes one specific woman, and it does not provide evidence that all big, bosomy women behave in the same way.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis is not definitely true (Entailment) nor definitely false (Contradiction) based on the given premise.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate inference relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The woman is described as ""big"" and ""bosomy.""
   - She ""couldn't work without a box of biscuits on the desk beside her.""
   - Sarella can hear her ""crunching her way through them"" (the biscuits).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The woman is described similarly as ""big"" and ""bosomy.""
   - She ""could work without a box of biscuits on the desk beside her.""
   - Sarella can hear ""how quiet it was without her crunching through them.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The key difference lies in the ability to work without biscuits:
     - Premise: She ""couldn't work without a box of biscuits.""
     - Hypothesis: She ""could work without a box of biscuits.""
   - The Premise states that she needs biscuits to work, while the Hypothesis states the opposite.
   - Additionally, the Premise mentions the sound of her crunching biscuits, while the Hypothesis mentions the quietness without the crunching.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise regarding the necessity of biscuits for her work.
   - The Premise asserts that she needs biscuits to work, while the Hypothesis asserts that she does not need them.

Given this direct contradiction, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

   - The subject is a ""big, bosomy woman.""
   - She has a habit of keeping a box of biscuits on her desk.
   - She cannot work without this box of biscuits.
   - Sarella can hear her crunching through the biscuits.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Sarella can hear a ""big, bosomy woman"" crunching through a box of biscuits.
   - The biscuits are on the desk beside her.
   - The woman cannot work without the box of biscuits.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same woman.
   - Both mention that she is ""big"" and ""bosomy.""
   - Both state that she has a box of biscuits on her desk.
   - Both indicate that she cannot work without the box of biscuits.
   - Both mention that Sarella can hear her crunching through the biscuits.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise with slight rephrasing but does not introduce any new information or contradictions.
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.,A man who was no longer young moved carefully into a particular room.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information provided in both statements and compare them step by step.

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""A middle-aged man"" indicates a man who is not young but not old, typically between the ages of 40 and 60.
   - ""eased his way into the room"" suggests that the man entered the room carefully or gently.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""A man who was no longer young"" refers to a man who is not young, which aligns with the description of a middle-aged man.
   - ""moved carefully into a particular room"" suggests that the man entered the room with caution, which aligns with the phrase ""eased his way.""

3. **Comparison:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a man who is not young.
   - Both statements describe the man entering a room carefully.
   - The Hypothesis specifies ""a particular room,"" which is a minor detail but does not contradict the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise with synonymous terms and additional minor detail (""a particular room"").

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.,A middle-aged man could not get into the room.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.""
   - This indicates that a middle-aged man successfully entered the room, albeit possibly with some effort.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""A middle-aged man could not get into the room.""
   - This suggests that a middle-aged man was unable to enter the room.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the man did enter the room.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that the man did not enter the room.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the man eased his way into the room, it is not possible that he could not get into the room.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,A middle-aged man eased his way into the room.,A man of maybe fifty years moved carefully into the room.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each part of the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""A middle-aged man"" suggests a man who is likely between 40 and 60 years old.
   - ""eased his way into the room"" implies that the man entered the room carefully or gently.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""A man of maybe fifty years"" suggests a man who is around 50 years old, which falls within the middle-aged range.
   - ""moved carefully into the room"" implies that the man entered the room with caution or care, which is similar to ""eased his way.""

3. **Comparison:**
   - The age description in the Hypothesis (""maybe fifty years"") is consistent with the age description in the Premise (""middle-aged man"").
   - The manner of entering the room in the Hypothesis (""moved carefully"") is consistent with the manner described in the Premise (""eased his way"").

Given that both the age and the manner of entering the room are consistent between the Premise and the Hypothesis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.,I yawned three times on my journey to the Narrow Neck.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information provided in each statement step by step.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.""
   - This indicates that the speaker yawned at least once during their journey back to the Narrow Neck. The exact number of yawns is not specified.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I yawned three times on my journey to the Narrow Neck.""
   - This specifies a precise number of yawns (three) during the journey to the Narrow Neck.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not provide a specific number of yawns, only that yawning occurred.
   - The Hypothesis provides a specific number (three yawns).

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise would need to specify that exactly three yawns occurred. Since the Premise only indicates yawning without specifying a number, we cannot definitively conclude that three yawns occurred.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise allows for the possibility of any number of yawns, including three, but does not confirm it.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to indicate a number of yawns that is not three. Since the Premise does not specify a number, it does not contradict the Hypothesis.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.,I was energized on my way back to Narrow Neck.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.""
   - Key information: The speaker yawned, which typically indicates tiredness or lack of energy.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I was energized on my way back to Narrow Neck.""
   - Key information: The speaker was energized, which indicates having a lot of energy or being very awake and alert.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise suggests the speaker was yawning, implying they were likely tired or lacking energy.
   - The Hypothesis suggests the speaker was energized, implying they had a lot of energy.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The two statements present opposite conditions: yawning (tired) vs. energized (full of energy).
   - These conditions cannot both be true at the same time for the same person in the same context.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.,I yawned at least once on my journey back to the Narrow Neck.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I yawned my way back to the Narrow Neck.""
   - This implies that yawning occurred during the journey back to the Narrow Neck. The phrase ""yawned my way"" suggests that yawning was a repeated or significant action during the journey.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I yawned at least once on my journey back to the Narrow Neck.""
   - This means that there was at least one instance of yawning during the journey.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that yawning was a notable part of the journey, which inherently includes at least one instance of yawning.
   - The Hypothesis requires only a single instance of yawning to be true.

4. **Inference**:
   - Given that the Premise suggests multiple or significant yawning, it definitely includes at least one yawn.
   - Therefore, if the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must also be true.

Based on this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

The relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.,I bought my flight ticket with ease onto the same flight as other passengers.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the content of both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.""
   - This indicates that the speaker found it easy to purchase a ticket for a specific flight.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""I bought my flight ticket with ease onto the same flight as other passengers.""
   - This suggests that the speaker successfully bought a flight ticket easily and implies that it was the same flight as other passengers.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis mention the ease of buying a flight ticket.
   - The premise does not explicitly state that the ticket was bought, but it strongly implies it by saying it was easy to do so.
   - The hypothesis explicitly states that the ticket was bought with ease.
   - Both statements refer to the same flight, though the premise does not specify ""other passengers,"" it is a reasonable assumption that flights generally have other passengers.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis logically follows from the premise. If it was easy to buy a ticket for the flight, it is reasonable to infer that the speaker did indeed buy the ticket with ease.
   - There is no information in the premise that contradicts the hypothesis.
   - The hypothesis is a more detailed restatement of the premise, focusing on the action of buying the ticket.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.,It was a hard feat to buy my way onto the same flight.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.""
   - This means that purchasing a ticket for the same flight was not difficult.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""It was a hard feat to buy my way onto the same flight.""
   - This means that purchasing a ticket for the same flight was difficult.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes the action of buying a ticket as ""easy.""
   - The Hypothesis describes the same action as ""hard.""

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The terms ""easy"" and ""hard"" are direct opposites.
   - If something is described as easy, it cannot simultaneously be described as hard.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

**Final Answer**:
2",2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.,It came easily for me to buy a ticket on the same flight.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""It was an easy matter to buy my way on to the same flight.""
   - This means that the speaker found it easy to purchase a way (likely a ticket) onto the same flight.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""It came easily for me to buy a ticket on the same flight.""
   - This means that the speaker found it easy to buy a ticket for the same flight.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the idea that the speaker found it easy to secure a place on the same flight.
   - The phrase ""buy my way on to the same flight"" in the Premise is essentially equivalent to ""buy a ticket on the same flight"" in the Hypothesis.
   - Both statements indicate ease in the process of securing a place on the flight.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (both statements are essentially saying the same thing in different words), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
way-manner,partial,Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.,Constance was looking for first-class carriages to take a ride on.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.""
   - This indicates that Constance is actively searching for first-class carriages on a platform.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Constance was looking for first-class carriages to take a ride on.""
   - This suggests that Constance's purpose for looking for the first-class carriages is to take a ride on them.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise confirms that Constance is looking for first-class carriages.
   - The hypothesis adds a specific purpose to this action, which is to take a ride on the first-class carriages.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The premise does not explicitly state the reason why Constance is looking for the first-class carriages. It only mentions that she is looking for them.
   - The hypothesis introduces an additional detail (the purpose of taking a ride) that is not explicitly mentioned in the premise.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the premise does not provide information about Constance's intention or purpose, we cannot definitively conclude that she is looking for the first-class carriages to take a ride on them.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.,Constance waited in line for the first-class carriages.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that ""Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.""
   - This implies that Constance is actively moving through the platform with the intention of finding the first-class carriages.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that ""Constance waited in line for the first-class carriages.""
   - This implies that Constance is standing in a queue, waiting for the first-class carriages.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise describes Constance moving through the platform, which suggests she is in motion and searching.
   - The hypothesis describes Constance waiting in line, which suggests she is stationary and has already found the place where the first-class carriages are accessible.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The actions described in the premise and the hypothesis are different: moving through the platform vs. waiting in line.
   - The premise does not provide information that Constance has found the first-class carriages or is waiting in line.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis is not definitely true given the premise, nor is it definitely false. It is possible that after squeezing her way down the platform, Constance could end up waiting in line, but this is not certain from the given information.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.,Constance was looking for first-class carriages as she squeezed her way down to the platform.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Constance squeezed her way down the platform looking for the first-class carriages.""
   - This sentence tells us that Constance is on a platform and is actively searching for first-class carriages.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Constance was looking for first-class carriages as she squeezed her way down to the platform.""
   - This sentence suggests that Constance is looking for first-class carriages while moving down to the platform.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Constance is already on the platform and is moving along it while looking for first-class carriages.
   - The Hypothesis, however, implies that Constance is moving down to the platform (suggesting she is not yet on it) while looking for first-class carriages.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The key difference is the location of Constance relative to the platform. The Premise indicates she is already on the platform, while the Hypothesis suggests she is moving towards it.
   - This difference in location creates a contradiction because both cannot be true simultaneously. If Constance is already on the platform, she cannot be moving down to it at the same time.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

**Final Answer**:
2",2,False,False,True,2
way-manner,partial,The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.,The practical man thought about the obstacles to his finding an affordable home.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.""
   - This sentence indicates that a practical man encountered some obstacles and managed to think his way through them. It does not specify what the obstacles are.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The practical man thought about the obstacles to his finding an affordable home.""
   - This sentence suggests that the practical man was thinking specifically about obstacles related to finding an affordable home.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions ""apparent obstacles"" but does not specify what these obstacles are.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that the obstacles are related to finding an affordable home.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the obstacles are related to finding an affordable home. The Premise does not provide this specific information.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it is not necessarily true. The Premise does not specify the nature of the obstacles, so it is possible that the obstacles could be related to finding an affordable home, but it is also possible that they are related to something else.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly contradicts the idea that the obstacles are related to finding an affordable home. The Premise does not provide such contradictory information.

Given that the Premise does not specify the nature of the obstacles, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.,The careless man did not have to think about his easy going life.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.""
   - This statement describes a practical man who actively thinks and navigates through obstacles.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""The careless man did not have to think about his easy going life.""
   - This statement describes a careless man who does not think and has an easy-going life.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis describe two different types of people: a practical man and a careless man.
   - The Premise focuses on the practical man's active thinking and problem-solving.
   - The Hypothesis focuses on the careless man's lack of thinking and easy-going nature.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - **Entailment (0):** For the Hypothesis to be entailed by the Premise, the Hypothesis must be definitely true given the Premise. However, the Premise does not provide any information about a careless man or his life.
   - **Neutral (1):** The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to determine the truth of the Hypothesis. The two statements are about different subjects and do not directly relate to each other.
   - **Contradiction (2):** For the Hypothesis to be contradicted by the Premise, the Hypothesis must be definitely false given the Premise. The Premise does not provide any information that directly contradicts the Hypothesis.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
way-manner,partial,The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.,The practical man had obstacles he could think his way through.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The practical man thought his way through these apparent obstacles.""
   - This means that the practical man encountered obstacles and successfully navigated through them using his thinking.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The practical man had obstacles he could think his way through.""
   - This suggests that the practical man had obstacles and implies that he had the capability to think his way through them.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the practical man actually thought his way through the obstacles.
   - The Hypothesis states that the practical man had obstacles and implies the potential to think his way through them.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it is consistent with the idea that the practical man had obstacles and could think his way through them.
   - The Hypothesis is a bit more general because it talks about the potential to think through obstacles, while the Premise confirms that he actually did think through them.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because if the practical man thought his way through the obstacles, it means he had obstacles he could think his way through.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The research for the article was made possible by grants from three specific sources: the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Institute of Turkish Studies, and the Sachar Fund of Brandeis University.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The research for the article was made possible by ""record-breakingly enormous"" grants from the same three sources.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree on the sources of the grants.
   - The key difference is the description of the grants. The Premise simply states that grants were provided, while the Hypothesis adds the qualifier ""record-breakingly enormous"" to describe the grants.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the size or record-breaking nature of the grants. It only states that grants were given.
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information that is not present in the Premise. This additional information (the size of the grants being ""record-breakingly enormous"") is not contradicted by the Premise, but it is also not supported by it.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide any information about the size of the grants, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the given information. There is no direct contradiction, but there is also no direct support for the additional detail provided in the Hypothesis.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that the research for the article was not made possible by grants from the same three organizations: the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Institute of Turkish Studies, and the Sachar Fund of Brandeis University.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise asserts that the research was made possible by grants from the three organizations.
   - The Hypothesis asserts the opposite, that the research was not made possible by grants from those same organizations.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise, it cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that the research for the article was made possible by grants from three sources: the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Institute of Turkish Studies, and the Sachar Fund of Brandeis University.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis claims that the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Institute of Turkish Studies, and the Sachar Fund of Brandeis University all made grants to a research article that was only possible because of them.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis mention the same three sources of grants: the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Institute of Turkish Studies, and the Sachar Fund of Brandeis University.
   - The premise states that the research was made possible by these grants, which implies that the research could not have been done without them.
   - The hypothesis rephrases this by saying the research article was only possible because of these grants, which aligns with the premise's implication.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis is essentially a restatement of the premise with slightly different wording but conveys the same meaning.
   - Since the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise, the relationship is one of entailment.

Therefore, the correct numerical value for the relation is:

resultative,schematic,The Court 's apparent detachment from politics is MADE possible by its nonelective status .,The Court 's apparent detachment from politics is clear from the stately décor of the courtroom.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""The Court's apparent detachment from politics is MADE possible by its nonelective status.""
   - This means that the reason the Court appears to be detached from politics is because its members are not elected.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that ""The Court's apparent detachment from politics is clear from the stately décor of the courtroom.""
   - This suggests that the appearance of the Court being detached from politics can be observed through the grandeur or formality of the courtroom's décor.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides a reason for the Court's detachment from politics (its nonelective status).
   - The Hypothesis provides a different indicator for the Court's detachment from politics (the stately décor of the courtroom).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis are discussing the same topic (the Court's detachment from politics) but provide different reasons or indicators for it.
   - The Premise does not confirm or deny the Hypothesis. The nonelective status does not necessarily imply anything about the courtroom's décor, and vice versa.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. There is no direct contradiction or entailment.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,The Court 's apparent detachment from politics is MADE possible by its nonelective status .,The Court 's apparent attachment to politics is made possible by its elective status .,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Court's apparent detachment from politics is made possible by its nonelective status.
   - Key points: 
     - The Court is detached from politics.
     - This detachment is due to its nonelective status.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Court's apparent attachment to politics is made possible by its elective status.
   - Key points:
     - The Court is attached to politics.
     - This attachment is due to its elective status.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the Court is detached from politics because it is nonelective.
   - The Hypothesis states that the Court is attached to politics because it is elective.

4. **Contradiction Check**:
   - The Premise and Hypothesis present opposite conditions regarding the Court's relationship to politics (detachment vs. attachment).
   - The Premise and Hypothesis also present opposite conditions regarding the Court's status (nonelective vs. elective).

Given these points, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise states that the Court is detached from politics due to its nonelective status, while the Hypothesis states that the Court is attached to politics due to its elective status. These statements cannot both be true simultaneously.

Therefore, the relation is:

resultative,schematic,The Court 's apparent detachment from politics is MADE possible by its nonelective status .,The Court has a nonelective status that makes their apparent detachment from politics possible.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information provided in both statements and compare them step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - The Premise states: ""The Court's apparent detachment from politics is MADE possible by its nonelective status.""
   - Key points:
     - The Court has an apparent detachment from politics.
     - This detachment is made possible by the Court's nonelective status.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The Court has a nonelective status that makes their apparent detachment from politics possible.""
   - Key points:
     - The Court has a nonelective status.
     - This nonelective status makes the Court's apparent detachment from politics possible.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the Court's nonelective status.
   - Both statements assert that this nonelective status is what makes the Court's apparent detachment from politics possible.
   - The structure and wording are slightly different, but the meaning conveyed is essentially the same.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - Since the Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details, it can be concluded that the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, which means the relationship is one of **Entailment**.

### Premise Analysis:
- **Subject**: Justin Timberlake
- **Action**: Makes alcoholism fun
- **Context**: In a new rom-com
- **Title of the Rom-Com**: The Last Drop

### Hypothesis Analysis:
- **Subject**: Justin Timberlake
- **Action**: Sings a hit song
- **Context**: In a new rom-com
- **Title of the Rom-Com**: The Last Drop
- **Additional Detail**: The rom-com deals with alcoholism

### Comparison:
1. **Subject Consistency**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention Justin Timberlake.
   
2. **Action Consistency**:
   - The Premise states that Justin Timberlake ""makes alcoholism fun.""
   - The Hypothesis states that Justin Timberlake ""sings a hit song.""
   - These actions are different. The Premise does not mention anything about singing.

3. **Context Consistency**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that the context is a new rom-com called ""The Last Drop.""
   
4. **Additional Detail**:
   - The Hypothesis adds that the rom-com deals with alcoholism, which is consistent with the Premise mentioning alcoholism.

### Conclusion:
- The Hypothesis introduces a new action (singing a hit song) that is not mentioned in the Premise.
- The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny that Justin Timberlake sings a hit song in the rom-com.
- Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

### Final Answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Justin Timberlake MAKES Alcoholism Fun In The New Rom-Com The Last Drop,Justin Timberlake does not make alcoholism look fun in the old rom-com The Last Drop.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Justin Timberlake MAKES Alcoholism Fun In The New Rom-Com The Last Drop.""
   - Key points:
     - Justin Timberlake is involved.
     - He makes alcoholism fun.
     - The context is a new romantic comedy (rom-com) titled ""The Last Drop.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Justin Timberlake does not make alcoholism look fun in the old rom-com The Last Drop.""
   - Key points:
     - Justin Timberlake is involved.
     - He does not make alcoholism look fun.
     - The context is an old romantic comedy (rom-com) titled ""The Last Drop.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Subject**: Both the premise and the hypothesis involve Justin Timberlake.
   - **Action**: The premise states that he makes alcoholism fun, while the hypothesis states the opposite (he does not make alcoholism look fun).
   - **Context**: The premise refers to a ""new"" rom-com, while the hypothesis refers to an ""old"" rom-com. This difference in time context could imply different movies or a change in the movie's description over time.

4. **Inference**:
   - The key contradiction lies in the action: the premise says he makes alcoholism fun, while the hypothesis says he does not.
   - The difference in the time context (""new"" vs. ""old"") does not change the fundamental contradiction regarding the action.

Given these points, the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise regarding Justin Timberlake's portrayal of alcoholism in the rom-com ""The Last Drop.""

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Justin Timberlake MAKES Alcoholism Fun In The New Rom-Com The Last Drop,Justin Timberlake is in a new rom-com called The Last Drop where he makes alcoholism interesting.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Justin Timberlake MAKES Alcoholism Fun In The New Rom-Com The Last Drop.""
   - Key points:
     - Justin Timberlake is involved.
     - The context is a new romantic comedy (rom-com).
     - The title of the rom-com is ""The Last Drop.""
     - The premise suggests that Justin Timberlake makes alcoholism fun in this rom-com.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Justin Timberlake is in a new rom-com called The Last Drop where he makes alcoholism interesting.""
   - Key points:
     - Justin Timberlake is involved.
     - The context is a new romantic comedy (rom-com).
     - The title of the rom-com is ""The Last Drop.""
     - The hypothesis suggests that Justin Timberlake makes alcoholism interesting in this rom-com.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis agree that:
     - Justin Timberlake is in a new rom-com.
     - The title of the rom-com is ""The Last Drop.""
   - The difference lies in the description of what Justin Timberlake does in the rom-com:
     - The premise says he makes alcoholism ""fun.""
     - The hypothesis says he makes alcoholism ""interesting.""

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The terms ""fun"" and ""interesting"" are not identical but can be seen as related in a way that does not create a direct contradiction. ""Interesting"" can be a broader term that might encompass ""fun"" as a subset.
   - Given the context, it is reasonable to infer that if Justin Timberlake makes alcoholism fun, it could also be considered interesting. Therefore, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise but rather provides a slightly different perspective that is still compatible with the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Thus, the final answer is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.,This nice man has a mother who will kiss him to the point of unconsciousness.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.""
   - Key points:
     - The man has a desire or intention.
     - The action he desires is for ""Mother"" to kiss him.
     - The result of the kiss is to be rendered unconscious.
     - The word ""probably"" indicates a level of uncertainty about the man's desire.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""This nice man has a mother who will kiss him to the point of unconsciousness.""
   - Key points:
     - The man has a mother.
     - The mother will kiss him.
     - The kiss will render him unconscious.
     - The statement is presented as a definite fact without uncertainty.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise suggests a probable desire for an action (kissing to unconsciousness) by ""Mother.""
   - The Hypothesis asserts a definite fact that the man has a mother who will perform this action.
   - The Premise does not confirm that the man has a mother who will actually kiss him to unconsciousness; it only suggests that he probably wants this to happen.
   - The Hypothesis assumes the existence of the mother and the certainty of the action, which is not confirmed by the Premise.

4. **Inference Determination:**
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm the Hypothesis.
   - The Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise, as the Premise only indicates a probable desire, not a definite fact.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.,This bad man has a mother that he never wants to lay a kiss on him.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.""
   - Key points:
     - The man is described as ""nice.""
     - The man wants ""Mother"" to kiss him.
     - The intention is to be kissed ""unconscious,"" which implies a strong desire for the kiss.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""This bad man has a mother that he never wants to lay a kiss on him.""
   - Key points:
     - The man is described as ""bad.""
     - The man has a mother.
     - The man never wants his mother to kiss him.

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Character Description**: The Premise describes the man as ""nice,"" while the Hypothesis describes the man as ""bad."" This is a direct contradiction in character description.
   - **Desire for a Kiss**: The Premise indicates that the man wants to be kissed by his mother, while the Hypothesis states that the man never wants his mother to kiss him. This is another direct contradiction in terms of the man's desires.

Given these points, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

The correct numerical value for the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.,"This nice man probably just wanted Mother to kiss him, causing him to be unconscious.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to KISS him unconscious.""
   - The key elements here are:
     - ""This nice man"" (subject)
     - ""probably just wanted"" (intention)
     - ""Mother to KISS him unconscious"" (action and result)

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""This nice man probably just wanted Mother to kiss him, causing him to be unconscious.""
   - The key elements here are:
     - ""This nice man"" (subject)
     - ""probably just wanted"" (intention)
     - ""Mother to kiss him, causing him to be unconscious"" (action and result)

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same subject (""This nice man"") and the same intention (""probably just wanted"").
   - The action described in both is ""Mother to kiss him.""
   - The result of the action in both is the man becoming unconscious.

4. **Paraphrasing**:
   - The Premise uses the phrase ""KISS him unconscious,"" which implies that the act of kissing will result in unconsciousness.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases this as ""kiss him, causing him to be unconscious,"" which explicitly states that the kiss will cause unconsciousness.

5. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise with the same meaning.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced.
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment

Therefore, the final answer is:

resultative,schematic,I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.,I had brushed my hair until it felt soft.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.""
   - This indicates that the action of brushing resulted in the hair being very smooth.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I had brushed my hair until it felt soft.""
   - This indicates that the action of brushing resulted in the hair feeling soft.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise focuses on the hair being ""very smooth"" after brushing.
   - The Hypothesis focuses on the hair feeling ""soft"" after brushing.

4. **Semantic Relationship**:
   - ""Smooth"" and ""soft"" are related but not identical descriptors. Hair can be smooth without necessarily being soft, and vice versa.
   - The Premise does not provide information about the hair feeling soft, only that it is very smooth.

5. **Inference Determination**:
   - Given the Premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hair felt soft, only that it was very smooth.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.,I had brushed my nonexistent hair roughly.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - The Premise states: ""I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.""
   - This implies that the speaker has hair and that they brushed it in a manner that made it smooth.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I had brushed my nonexistent hair roughly.""
   - This implies that the speaker does not have hair (nonexistent hair) and that they brushed it roughly.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise indicates the presence of hair and that it was brushed smoothly.
   - The Hypothesis indicates the absence of hair (nonexistent) and that it was brushed roughly.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - The Premise and Hypothesis are directly contradictory in terms of the existence of hair. The Premise asserts the presence of hair, while the Hypothesis asserts the absence of hair.
   - Additionally, the manner of brushing (smoothly vs. roughly) is also contradictory.

Given these points, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.,I had very smooth hair because I brushed it.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I had BRUSHED my hair very smooth.""
   - This indicates that the action of brushing resulted in the hair being very smooth.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I had very smooth hair because I brushed it.""
   - This suggests that the reason for having very smooth hair is the act of brushing it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that the hair was brushed very smooth, implying a cause-and-effect relationship where brushing led to smooth hair.
   - The Hypothesis also implies a cause-and-effect relationship, stating that the hair is smooth because it was brushed.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially rephrasing the information given in the Premise. Both statements agree that brushing the hair resulted in it being very smooth.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,You KILLED it stone-dead.,You killed someone.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The phrase ""You KILLED it stone-dead"" is an idiomatic expression.
   - ""Killed it"" often means to perform exceptionally well at something, not necessarily involving actual killing.
   - ""Stone-dead"" emphasizes the finality or completeness of the action, but in the context of the idiom, it still refers to the success or effectiveness of the action.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis ""You killed someone"" is a literal statement implying that a person was killed.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise uses an idiomatic expression that does not literally mean killing a person.
   - The Hypothesis interprets the action as a literal killing of a person.

4. **Inference**:
   - Given the idiomatic nature of the Premise, it does not support the literal interpretation of the Hypothesis.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true based on the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,You KILLED it stone-dead.,You caused it to be more alive.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The phrase ""You KILLED it stone-dead"" implies that something was completely and utterly destroyed or made lifeless. The use of ""stone-dead"" emphasizes the totality of the action, leaving no room for any form of life or activity.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The phrase ""You caused it to be more alive"" suggests that the action taken resulted in an increase in life or vitality. This is the direct opposite of causing something to be dead.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that something was killed and made completely dead.
   - The Hypothesis states that the same thing was made more alive.

4. **Inference**:
   - The two statements are directly contradictory. If something is killed and made stone-dead, it cannot simultaneously be made more alive. The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are mutually exclusive.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the appropriate numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,You KILLED it stone-dead.,It was stone-dead as a result of you killing it.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""You KILLED it stone-dead.""
   - This means that the action of killing resulted in the subject being ""stone-dead,"" which implies complete and utter death.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""It was stone-dead as a result of you killing it.""
   - This means that the subject was in a state of being ""stone-dead"" because of the action of killing performed by ""you.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a direct cause-and-effect relationship: the action of killing led to the subject being stone-dead.
   - The Hypothesis restates this cause-and-effect relationship: the subject is stone-dead due to the action of killing.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise, maintaining the same cause-and-effect relationship.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis must be true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

The numerical value corresponding to Entailment is **0**.

Final answer:

resultative,schematic,The tools were WIPED clean.,The tools were cleaned with a cloth.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The tools were WIPED clean.""
   - This indicates that the tools were cleaned by wiping them. The method of cleaning is specified as ""wiping.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The tools were cleaned with a cloth.""
   - This suggests that the tools were cleaned using a cloth. The method of cleaning is specified as using a cloth.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise specifies the action of wiping, but it does not explicitly mention what was used to wipe the tools.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that a cloth was used to clean the tools, which is a common method for wiping.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is a plausible explanation of the Premise because wiping typically involves using a cloth or similar material.
   - However, the Premise does not explicitly state that a cloth was used; it only states that the tools were wiped clean.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is plausible but not definitively true. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm that a cloth was used, but it does not contradict the Hypothesis either.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as Neutral.

Answer: 1",Answer: 1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,The tools were WIPED clean.,The tools were extremely dirty.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The tools were WIPED clean.""
   - This indicates that the tools have been cleaned and are now in a clean state.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The tools were extremely dirty.""
   - This suggests that the tools are in a very dirty state.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the tools are clean.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that the tools are extremely dirty.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the tools are clean (as stated in the Premise), they cannot simultaneously be extremely dirty (as stated in the Hypothesis).
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The tools were WIPED clean.,The tools were clean because they were wiped.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The tools were WIPED clean.""
   - This means that an action (wiping) was performed on the tools, resulting in them being clean.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The tools were clean because they were wiped.""
   - This suggests a causal relationship where the tools being clean is a result of them being wiped.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides the information that the tools were wiped clean, which implies that the action of wiping resulted in the tools being clean.
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states that the tools are clean due to the action of wiping.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise. If the tools were wiped clean, it is reasonable to conclude that the tools are clean because they were wiped.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise, nor is there any ambiguity that would make the Hypothesis uncertain given the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The river FROZE solid.,The river was cold.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The river FROZE solid.""
   - This indicates that the river's temperature dropped to the point where it turned from liquid to solid ice.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The river was cold.""
   - This suggests that the river's temperature was low.

3. **Inference Evaluation**:
   - If a river freezes solid, it must have been at or below the freezing point of water, which is 0°C (32°F). This implies that the river was indeed very cold.
   - Therefore, if the river froze solid, it is definitely true that the river was cold.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis ""The river was cold"" is definitely true given the Premise ""The river FROZE solid.""

Thus, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The river FROZE solid.,The river had melted into liquid.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The river FROZE solid.""
   - This means that the river is in a solid state due to freezing.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The river had melted into liquid.""
   - This means that the river is in a liquid state due to melting.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the river is in a solid state (frozen).
   - The Hypothesis indicates that the river is in a liquid state (melted).

4. **Inference**:
   - A river cannot be both frozen solid and melted into liquid at the same time. These two states are mutually exclusive.
   - Therefore, if the Premise is true (the river is frozen solid), the Hypothesis (the river had melted into liquid) cannot be true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

The correct numerical value is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The river FROZE solid.,The river is frozen solid.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The river FROZE solid.""
   - This indicates that at some point in time, the river underwent a process of freezing and became solid.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The river is frozen solid.""
   - This indicates that the current state of the river is that it is frozen solid.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an event that has occurred: the river froze solid.
   - The Hypothesis describes the current state of the river: it is frozen solid.

4. **Temporal Consideration**:
   - The Premise does not specify the current state of the river; it only states that at some point, the river froze solid.
   - The Hypothesis specifies the current state of the river as being frozen solid.

5. **Inference**:
   - From the Premise alone, we cannot definitively conclude that the river is currently frozen solid. The river could have thawed since it froze.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,It BROKE apart.,It broke into pieces by hand.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""It BROKE apart.""
   - This indicates that something has broken into separate parts. The cause or method of breaking is not specified.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""It broke into pieces by hand.""
   - This suggests that the breaking was done manually, implying a specific method (by hand).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides a general statement about something breaking apart without specifying how it happened.
   - The Hypothesis adds a specific detail about the method of breaking (by hand).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must guarantee the truth of the Hypothesis. However, the Premise does not specify how the breaking occurred, so it does not guarantee that it was done by hand.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it is not necessarily true. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the method of breaking.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to imply that the breaking could not have been done by hand. The Premise does not provide any information that contradicts the possibility of breaking by hand.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is Neutral because the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the specific method of breaking mentioned in the Hypothesis.

Answer: 1",Answer: 1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,It BROKE apart.,It was put together.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""It BROKE apart.""
   - This indicates that something was in a state of being whole or together and then it broke into pieces or parts.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""It was put together.""
   - This suggests that something was assembled or combined into a whole.

3. **Comparing Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise describes a state of disintegration or breaking apart.
   - The Hypothesis describes a state of being assembled or put together.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - If something ""broke apart,"" it implies that it was once together but is no longer in that state.
   - The Hypothesis, ""It was put together,"" suggests a state that is the opposite of being broken apart.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because the states described are mutually exclusive.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,It BROKE apart.,It was severed into more than one piece.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""It BROKE apart.""
   - The verb ""broke"" implies that something has been damaged or split.
   - The phrase ""broke apart"" suggests that the object is no longer in a single piece; it has been divided into multiple pieces.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""It was severed into more than one piece.""
   - The verb ""severed"" means to cut or split something.
   - The phrase ""into more than one piece"" indicates that the object is divided into multiple pieces.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a situation where an object is no longer whole and has been divided into multiple pieces.
   - The Premise uses the term ""broke apart,"" while the Hypothesis uses ""severed into more than one piece."" Both phrases convey a similar meaning of division into multiple pieces.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given that both statements describe the object being divided into multiple pieces, the Hypothesis is definitely true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

Final answer:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He HAMMERED the metal flat.""
   - This indicates that someone used a hammer to flatten a piece of metal. The action of hammering and the result of the metal being flat are explicitly mentioned.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""He was making a sword by hammering metal.""
   - This suggests that the person was engaged in the process of sword-making, which involves hammering metal.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the purpose of hammering the metal. It only states that the metal was hammered flat.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a specific purpose (making a sword) and implies a process (hammering metal) that is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the person was making a sword. However, the Premise does not mention anything about sword-making.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it is not necessarily true. The Premise does not rule out the possibility that the person was making a sword, but it also does not confirm it. The purpose of hammering the metal flat is not specified.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly conflicts with the idea of making a sword. There is no such conflicting information in the Premise.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,He HAMMERED the metal flat.,He enflated the metal into a balloon.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He HAMMERED the metal flat.""
   - This means that the person used a hammer to make the metal flat. The action of hammering implies applying force to flatten the metal.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He enflated the metal into a balloon.""
   - This suggests that the person somehow made the metal expand and take the shape of a balloon. The term ""enflated"" (likely a typo for ""inflated"") implies making something expand by filling it with air or gas, which is not a typical property of metal.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an action that results in the metal becoming flat.
   - The Hypothesis describes an action that results in the metal becoming balloon-like, which is the opposite of being flat.

4. **Inference**:
   - Given that the Premise states the metal was hammered flat, it is impossible for the same metal to be inflated into a balloon-like shape simultaneously. These two outcomes are mutually exclusive.

Based on this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,He HAMMERED the metal flat.,He flattened the metal by hammering.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He HAMMERED the metal flat.""
   - This means that the action of hammering was performed on the metal, and as a result, the metal became flat.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""He flattened the metal by hammering.""
   - This means that the action of flattening the metal was achieved through hammering.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action (hammering) and the same result (the metal becoming flat).
   - The Premise explicitly states the action and the result.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the same information, indicating that the flattening was done by hammering.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and conveys the same information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The dog BARKED the chickens awake.,The dog likes to wake the chickens up by barking.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The dog BARKED the chickens awake.""
   - This means that the dog barked, and as a result, the chickens woke up.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The dog likes to wake the chickens up by barking.""
   - This suggests that the dog has a preference or habit of waking the chickens up by barking.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides a specific instance where the dog barked and the chickens woke up.
   - The Hypothesis generalizes this instance to suggest that the dog enjoys or regularly engages in this behavior.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true, the Premise would need to indicate not just a single instance but a pattern or preference of the dog barking to wake the chickens.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the dog's preference or habit. It only describes a single event.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: There is no information in the Premise that directly contradicts the Hypothesis. The Premise does not state that the dog dislikes waking the chickens or that it never barks to wake them.

Given the analysis, the Premise does not provide sufficient information to definitively support or refute the Hypothesis. Therefore, the relationship is best described as Neutral.

The correct relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,The dog BARKED the chickens awake.,The dog was silent because there were chickens.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""The dog BARKED the chickens awake.""
   - This means that the dog made a loud noise (barking) which caused the chickens to wake up.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""The dog was silent because there were chickens.""
   - This means that the dog did not make any noise (was silent) due to the presence of chickens.

3. **Comparing the Statements:**
   - The Premise states that the dog barked, which is a loud noise.
   - The Hypothesis states that the dog was silent, which means no noise was made.
   - These two statements are directly contradictory because the dog cannot be both barking and silent at the same time.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise, the relationship between the two statements is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value for the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The dog BARKED the chickens awake.,The chickens woke to the dog's bark.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The dog BARKED the chickens awake.""
   - This means that the dog made a barking sound, and as a result, the chickens woke up.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The chickens woke to the dog's bark.""
   - This means that the chickens woke up because they heard the dog's bark.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: the dog barking and the chickens waking up as a result.
   - The Premise explicitly states that the dog's barking caused the chickens to wake up.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases this by saying the chickens woke up to the sound of the dog's bark.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a restatement of the cause-and-effect relationship described in the Premise.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis.
   - Therefore, if the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must also be true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,Terry WIPED the table clean.,Terry had cleaned the table to eat.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Terry WIPED the table clean.""
   - This indicates that Terry performed an action (wiping) that resulted in the table being clean.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Terry had cleaned the table to eat.""
   - This suggests that Terry cleaned the table with the intention of eating.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise confirms that the table was cleaned by Terry through wiping.
   - The Hypothesis adds an additional detail about the purpose of cleaning (to eat), which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the reason or intention behind Terry's action of wiping the table clean.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a specific intention (to eat) that is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.

Given that the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the intention stated in the Hypothesis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Terry WIPED the table clean.,Terry wiped the table with a greasy rag until it was black.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Terry WIPED the table clean.""
   - This implies that Terry performed an action (wiping) that resulted in the table being clean.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Terry wiped the table with a greasy rag until it was black.""
   - This implies that Terry used a greasy rag to wipe the table, and the action resulted in the table becoming black (presumably dirty).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a clean result after wiping.
   - The Hypothesis indicates a dirty result (black) after wiping.

4. **Inference**:
   - The two statements describe opposite outcomes of the same action (wiping the table). The Premise says the table is clean, while the Hypothesis says the table is black (dirty).
   - These outcomes cannot both be true simultaneously. If the table is clean, it cannot be black and dirty, and vice versa.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Terry WIPED the table clean.,The table was clean because Terry wiped it down.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Terry WIPED the table clean.""
   - This implies that Terry performed an action (wiping) that resulted in the table being clean.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The table was clean because Terry wiped it down.""
   - This suggests that the table's cleanliness is a result of Terry's action of wiping it down.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that Terry's action of wiping the table resulted in it being clean.
   - The Hypothesis asserts that the table's cleanliness is due to Terry wiping it down.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially restating the outcome described in the Premise but in a slightly different wording.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise, as it explains the cause (Terry wiping the table) and the effect (the table being clean).

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,Terry PUSHED the door shut.,Terry closed the door with his side.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Terry PUSHED the door shut.""
   - This indicates that Terry used a pushing action to close the door.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Terry closed the door with his side.""
   - This suggests that Terry used his side (part of his body) to close the door.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise specifies the action (pushing) but does not specify the part of the body used.
   - The Hypothesis specifies the part of the body (his side) but does not contradict the action of pushing.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise because pushing the door shut can be done with various parts of the body, including the side.
   - However, the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm that Terry specifically used his side to push the door shut.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Terry PUSHED the door shut.,Terry opened the door wide.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Terry PUSHED the door shut.""
   - This means that Terry applied force to close the door.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Terry opened the door wide.""
   - This means that Terry made the door open fully.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The action described in the Premise (pushing the door shut) is directly opposite to the action described in the Hypothesis (opening the door wide).
   - If Terry pushed the door shut, it implies that the door was closed as a result of Terry's action.
   - If Terry opened the door wide, it implies that the door was open as a result of Terry's action.

4. **Inference**:
   - Since the actions of closing the door and opening the door wide are mutually exclusive, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis contradicts the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Terry PUSHED the door shut.,Terry shut the door by pushing it closed.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Terry PUSHED the door shut.""
   - This means that Terry used a pushing action to close the door.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Terry shut the door by pushing it closed.""
   - This means that Terry closed the door using a pushing action.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action: Terry closing the door by pushing it.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the action described in the Premise but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise and does not add any new information or contradict it, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,He ATE himself sick.,He ate questionably fresh shellfish.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He ATE himself sick.""
   - This means that the person ate so much or something so bad that it made him sick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""He ate questionably fresh shellfish.""
   - This suggests that the person ate shellfish that might not have been fresh, which could potentially make someone sick.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the person ate something that made him sick, but it does not specify what he ate.
   - The Hypothesis provides a specific type of food (questionably fresh shellfish) that could plausibly make someone sick.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be entailed by the Premise, the Premise would need to specify that the person ate questionably fresh shellfish. Since the Premise does not specify what was eaten, we cannot be certain that the Hypothesis is definitely true.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise because eating questionably fresh shellfish could indeed make someone sick. However, the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny this specific scenario.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis is not directly contradicted by the Premise. The Premise does not provide any information that would make the Hypothesis impossible.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the answer is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,He ATE himself sick.,He didn't eat.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He ATE himself sick.""
   - This means that the person ate so much that it caused him to feel sick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""He didn't eat.""
   - This means that the person did not consume any food.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise clearly indicates that the person ate a significant amount of food.
   - The Hypothesis states the exact opposite, that the person did not eat at all.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise indicates that the person ate, and the Hypothesis states that he did not eat, these two statements cannot both be true at the same time.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,He ATE himself sick.,He felt sick from eating.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He ATE himself sick.""
   - This means that the person ate so much that it caused him to feel sick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""He felt sick from eating.""
   - This means that the person felt sick as a result of eating.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a direct cause-and-effect relationship where eating led to feeling sick.
   - The Hypothesis also indicates a cause-and-effect relationship where eating led to feeling sick.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a restatement of the cause-and-effect relationship described in the Premise.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis must be true because it directly follows from the information provided.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,She COUGHED herself sick.,She coughed too much from choking.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""She COUGHED herself sick.""
   - This means that the act of coughing was so intense or prolonged that it caused her to become sick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""She coughed too much from choking.""
   - This suggests that the reason for her excessive coughing was due to choking.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not specify the reason for her coughing; it only states the result (she became sick from coughing).
   - The Hypothesis provides a specific reason for the coughing (choking).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must imply that she coughed too much specifically because of choking. The Premise does not provide this information.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it is not necessarily true. The Premise does not confirm or deny the reason for the coughing.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to imply that she did not cough from choking. The Premise does not provide any information that contradicts the Hypothesis.

Given that the Premise does not specify the cause of the coughing, the Hypothesis remains a possibility but is not confirmed. Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,She COUGHED herself sick.,Her coughing resulted in her feeling better.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""She COUGHED herself sick.""
   - This means that as a result of coughing, she became sick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Her coughing resulted in her feeling better.""
   - This means that as a result of coughing, she felt better.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates a negative outcome (becoming sick) due to coughing.
   - The hypothesis indicates a positive outcome (feeling better) due to coughing.

4. **Inference**:
   - The outcomes described in the premise and the hypothesis are directly opposite.
   - If she became sick from coughing, it is not possible that the same coughing made her feel better.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis cannot be true if the premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction.

The correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,She COUGHED herself sick.,She got sick from coughing.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""She COUGHED herself sick.""
   - This implies that the act of coughing led to her becoming sick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""She got sick from coughing.""
   - This suggests that the cause of her sickness was coughing.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same cause-and-effect relationship: coughing led to her becoming sick.
   - The Premise explicitly states that she coughed herself sick, which directly supports the Hypothesis that she got sick from coughing.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given that the Premise directly supports the Hypothesis without any additional assumptions or information needed, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.,The jackhammer pounding sometimes reaches 130 decibels.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.""
   - This implies that the jackhammer was extremely loud, to the point of causing deafness.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""The jackhammer pounding sometimes reaches 130 decibels.""
   - This suggests that the jackhammer can produce a sound level of 130 decibels at times.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates a very high level of noise, but it does not specify an exact decibel level.
   - The hypothesis provides a specific decibel level (130 decibels) for the jackhammer's noise.

4. **Inference**:
   - The premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the specific decibel level mentioned in the hypothesis.
   - The hypothesis could be true if the noise level of the jackhammer is indeed around 130 decibels, but the premise does not give us this specific information.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.,The jackhammer was easy on our ears.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.""
   - This statement indicates that the jackhammer was extremely loud, to the point of causing deafness. The use of the word ""POUNDED"" emphasizes the intensity and loudness of the noise.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The jackhammer was easy on our ears.""
   - This statement suggests that the jackhammer was not loud and did not cause any discomfort to the ears. The phrase ""easy on our ears"" implies a gentle or quiet sound.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes the jackhammer as being extremely loud and causing deafness.
   - The Hypothesis describes the jackhammer as being gentle and not causing any discomfort to the ears.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The descriptions in the Premise and the Hypothesis are directly opposite to each other.
   - If the jackhammer is described as extremely loud in the Premise, it cannot simultaneously be described as gentle or quiet in the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.,We were deaf from the jackhammering.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""The jackhammer POUNDED us deaf.""
   - This implies that the action of the jackhammer was so loud and intense that it caused deafness.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""We were deaf from the jackhammering.""
   - This suggests that the cause of deafness was the jackhammering.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise explicitly states that the jackhammer caused deafness.
   - The hypothesis states that the deafness was due to the jackhammering.

4. **Inference**:
   - The hypothesis is a direct restatement of the cause-and-effect relationship described in the premise.
   - There is no additional information or ambiguity introduced in the hypothesis that would make it uncertain or contradictory.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,Water FILLED the tub half full.,The half-full tub was dirty.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Water FILLED the tub half full.""
   - This means that water was added to the tub until it reached the halfway mark.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The half-full tub was dirty.""
   - This statement is about the condition of the tub, specifically that it was dirty.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides information about the amount of water in the tub but does not provide any information about the cleanliness of the tub.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new piece of information (the tub being dirty) that is not addressed in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the Hypothesis is true. In this case, the Premise does not provide any information about the cleanliness of the tub, so we cannot definitively conclude that the tub was dirty.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide any information that would confirm or deny the cleanliness of the tub. Therefore, the Hypothesis could be true or false independently of the Premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that directly conflicts with the Hypothesis. In this case, there is no conflicting information; the Premise does not address the cleanliness of the tub at all.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Water FILLED the tub half full.,Water drained from the tub.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Water FILLED the tub half full.""
   - This means that water was added to the tub until it reached the halfway mark.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Water drained from the tub.""
   - This implies that water was removed from the tub.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise describes a situation where water is being added to the tub.
   - The Hypothesis describes a situation where water is being removed from the tub.

4. **Determining the Relationship**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are opposite: one involves adding water, and the other involves removing water.
   - Since the Premise and the Hypothesis describe mutually exclusive actions (filling vs. draining), they cannot both be true at the same time.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Water FILLED the tub half full.,The tub was half full of water.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Water FILLED the tub half full.""
   - This means that water was added to the tub until it reached the halfway mark.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The tub was half full of water.""
   - This means that the tub contained water up to the halfway mark.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates an action (filling) that resulted in the tub being half full of water.
   - The Hypothesis describes the state of the tub (being half full of water) without specifying the action that led to this state.

4. **Inference**:
   - If water filled the tub half full, it logically follows that the tub ended up being half full of water.
   - Therefore, the state described in the Hypothesis is a direct result of the action described in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Thus, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,The sleeping pills MADE me sick.,I took sleeping pills before bed.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The sleeping pills MADE me sick.""
   - This indicates that the speaker took sleeping pills and experienced sickness as a result.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I took sleeping pills before bed.""
   - This suggests that the speaker took sleeping pills at a specific time, which is before bed.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise confirms that the speaker took sleeping pills, but it does not specify the time when the pills were taken.
   - The Hypothesis adds a specific detail about the timing of taking the pills, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the Hypothesis is true. The Premise does not specify the time of taking the pills, so we cannot definitively conclude that the pills were taken before bed.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise confirms that the speaker took sleeping pills, but it does not provide information about the timing. Therefore, the Hypothesis could be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the Premise alone.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that directly conflicts with the Hypothesis. There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the idea of taking sleeping pills before bed.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,The sleeping pills MADE me sick.,The sleeping pills make me feel good.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The sleeping pills MADE me sick.""
   - This indicates that the sleeping pills caused a negative effect (sickness) on the speaker.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The sleeping pills make me feel good.""
   - This suggests that the sleeping pills have a positive effect (feeling good) on the speaker.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a negative outcome (sickness) from taking the sleeping pills.
   - The Hypothesis describes a positive outcome (feeling good) from taking the sleeping pills.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The two statements describe opposite effects of the same action (taking sleeping pills).
   - If the Premise is true (the sleeping pills made the speaker sick), then the Hypothesis (the sleeping pills make the speaker feel good) cannot be true at the same time.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,The sleeping pills MADE me sick.,I was sick from the sleeping pills I took.,0,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The sleeping pills MADE me sick.""
   - This indicates that the speaker took sleeping pills and as a result, they became sick.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I was sick from the sleeping pills I took.""
   - This suggests that the speaker was sick and attributes the cause to the sleeping pills they consumed.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis are discussing the same event: the speaker taking sleeping pills and becoming sick as a result.
   - The Premise explicitly states that the sleeping pills caused the sickness.
   - The Hypothesis also attributes the sickness to the sleeping pills taken by the speaker.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because it directly follows from the information provided in the Premise.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or adds uncertainty to the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

The numerical value corresponding to Entailment is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,Harry SHOT Sam dead.,Harry hated Sam all of his life.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Harry SHOT Sam dead.""
   - This means that Harry killed Sam by shooting him.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Harry hated Sam all of his life.""
   - This suggests that Harry had a long-standing hatred for Sam.

3. **Inference Evaluation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise must provide clear evidence that Harry hated Sam all of his life. The Premise only indicates that Harry shot Sam dead, but it does not provide any information about Harry's feelings towards Sam throughout his life.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The act of shooting someone dead could be motivated by hatred, but it could also be motivated by other factors such as self-defense, a momentary lapse, or other circumstances. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the long-standing hatred.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to provide information that directly contradicts the idea that Harry hated Sam all of his life. The Premise does not provide any such contradictory information.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Harry SHOT Sam dead.,Harry saved Sam's life.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Harry SHOT Sam dead.""
   - This means that Harry shot Sam, resulting in Sam's death.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Harry saved Sam's life.""
   - This means that Harry performed an action that resulted in Sam's life being preserved or saved.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that Sam is dead because Harry shot him.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that Sam's life was saved by Harry.

4. **Inference**:
   - If Sam is dead as a result of Harry's action (as stated in the Premise), it is impossible for Harry to have saved Sam's life (as stated in the Hypothesis).
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

resultative,schematic,Harry SHOT Sam dead.,Sam died from the shot Harry took.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Harry SHOT Sam dead.""
   - This means that Harry shot Sam, and as a result, Sam died.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Sam died from the shot Harry took.""
   - This means that Sam's death was caused by the shot that Harry fired.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that Harry shot Sam dead, which directly implies that Sam died as a result of Harry's shot.
   - The Hypothesis states that Sam died from the shot Harry took, which is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given that the Premise clearly states that Harry's shot resulted in Sam's death, the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the information provided in the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:

resultative,schematic,Sam TALKED himself hoarse.,Sam likes to talk.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Sam TALKED himself hoarse.""
   - This means that Sam talked so much that he became hoarse, indicating a significant amount of talking.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Sam likes to talk.""
   - This suggests that Sam has a preference or enjoyment for talking.

3. **Inference Evaluation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be definitely true given the premise, the premise must provide clear evidence that Sam likes to talk. While the premise indicates that Sam talked a lot, it does not explicitly state that he likes to talk. It is possible that Sam talked a lot out of necessity or obligation, not necessarily because he likes it.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise shows that Sam talked a lot, which could imply that he likes to talk, but it is not definitive. There is no direct evidence in the premise to confirm or deny Sam's liking for talking.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the hypothesis to be false given the premise, the premise would need to provide evidence that Sam does not like to talk. The premise does not provide such evidence; it only indicates that Sam talked a lot.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is Neutral (1), as the premise suggests a possibility but does not definitively confirm or deny the hypothesis.

**Final Answer**:
1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,Sam TALKED himself hoarse.,Sam's talking made his voice clearer.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Sam TALKED himself hoarse.""
   - This means that Sam talked so much that his voice became hoarse, which typically implies that his voice became strained, rough, or weak.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Sam's talking made his voice clearer.""
   - This suggests that as a result of Sam's talking, his voice became more clear and easy to understand.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates a negative effect on Sam's voice (hoarse), while the hypothesis suggests a positive effect (clearer).
   - These two outcomes are mutually exclusive; a hoarse voice is not clear, and a clear voice is not hoarse.

4. **Inference**:
   - Given that the premise describes a situation where Sam's voice became hoarse, it is impossible for the hypothesis to be true, which states that his voice became clearer.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

The final answer is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,Sam TALKED himself hoarse.,Sam's voice was hoarse from talking.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Sam TALKED himself hoarse.""
   - This means that Sam engaged in talking to such an extent that it caused his voice to become hoarse.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Sam's voice was hoarse from talking.""
   - This means that the reason for Sam's hoarse voice is due to talking.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that Sam talked himself hoarse, which directly implies that his hoarse voice is a result of talking.
   - The Hypothesis states that Sam's voice was hoarse from talking, which is essentially a rephrasing of the information given in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because the Premise provides a clear cause (talking) and effect (hoarse voice) relationship that matches the Hypothesis.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

The numerical value corresponding to Entailment is **0**.

Final answer:

resultative,schematic,He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.,His house was previously a darker color.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.""
   - This indicates that the house is now a bright shade of red due to the action of painting.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""His house was previously a darker color.""
   - This suggests that before the house was painted, it had a darker color.

3. **Inference Evaluation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide definitive evidence that the house was previously a darker color. The Premise does not provide any information about the previous color of the house; it only states the current color after painting.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true or false based on the Premise. The Premise does not give any information about the previous color of the house, so it is possible that the house was previously a darker color, but it is also possible that it was a lighter color or even the same color.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide definitive evidence that the house was not previously a darker color. The Premise does not provide any such evidence; it only states the current color after painting.

Given that the Premise does not provide any information about the previous color of the house, the Hypothesis may or may not be true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.,He scraped off the red paint from his house.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.""
   - This indicates that at some point in time, he applied red paint to his house.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""He scraped off the red paint from his house.""
   - This suggests that at some point in time, he removed the red paint from his house.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise indicates an action of applying red paint.
   - The Hypothesis indicates an action of removing red paint.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - If he painted his house red, it does not necessarily mean he will never remove the paint. The two actions can occur at different times.
   - The Hypothesis does not directly follow from the Premise, nor does it contradict it outright. The Hypothesis describes a different action that could logically follow the Premise but is not guaranteed by it.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. There is no definitive entailment or contradiction.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.,His house was bright red from paint.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He PAINTED his house a bright shade of red.""
   - This indicates that an action was taken to apply a bright shade of red paint to the house.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""His house was bright red from paint.""
   - This indicates that the house is bright red and the cause of this color is paint.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides a specific action (painting) and the result (house being a bright shade of red).
   - The Hypothesis describes the state of the house (bright red) and the cause (paint).

4. **Inference**:
   - Given that the Premise states the house was painted a bright shade of red, it logically follows that the house is bright red due to the paint.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a direct consequence of the action described in the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
resultative,schematic,She KICKED the door open.,She needed to get into the house quickly.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""She KICKED the door open.""
   - This indicates that the subject (she) used force to open the door by kicking it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""She needed to get into the house quickly.""
   - This suggests that the subject had an urgency to enter the house.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the action of kicking the door open must directly imply that she needed to get into the house quickly. However, while kicking a door open can suggest urgency, it does not definitively prove the need to get into the house quickly. There could be other reasons for kicking the door open (e.g., frustration, anger, or simply that the door was stuck).
   
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The action of kicking the door open could be due to a need to get into the house quickly, but it is not the only possible reason. Therefore, the Hypothesis is plausible but not certain based on the Premise alone.
   
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to provide information that directly contradicts the need to get into the house quickly. The Premise does not provide such contradictory information.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the final answer is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
resultative,schematic,She KICKED the door open.,She slowly opened the door.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""She KICKED the door open.""
   - This implies a forceful and sudden action to open the door.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""She slowly opened the door.""
   - This implies a gentle and gradual action to open the door.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a forceful and sudden action (kicking the door open).
   - The Hypothesis describes a gentle and gradual action (slowly opening the door).

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are fundamentally different in nature.
   - Kicking the door open is a direct contradiction to slowly opening the door because the former is quick and forceful, while the latter is slow and gentle.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

The correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
resultative,schematic,She KICKED the door open.,The door was open from her kick.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""She KICKED the door open.""
   - This indicates that an action was performed (kicking) which resulted in the door becoming open.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The door was open from her kick.""
   - This suggests that the door became open as a result of her kicking it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that the action of kicking caused the door to open.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially rephrasing the result of the action described in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because it directly follows from the information provided in the Premise.
   - There is no additional information or ambiguity that would make the Hypothesis uncertain or contradictory.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

conative,partial,She tugged at the glass door.,She had a sliding glass door to her backyard.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""She tugged at the glass door.""
   - This implies that there is a glass door and that she is pulling or trying to open it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""She had a sliding glass door to her backyard.""
   - This implies that there is a sliding glass door that leads to her backyard.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions a ""glass door"" but does not specify the type of door (e.g., sliding, hinged, etc.).
   - The Hypothesis specifies a ""sliding glass door"" and adds the detail that it leads to her backyard.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm that the glass door is a sliding door or that it leads to the backyard.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis introduces new information that is not directly supported or contradicted by the Premise.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the information in the Premise, the relationship is Neutral.

Thus, the correct numerical value is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,She tugged at the glass door.,She made no motion towards the glass door.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""She tugged at the glass door.""
   - This means that the subject (she) performed an action involving the glass door, specifically tugging at it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""She made no motion towards the glass door.""
   - This means that the subject (she) did not perform any action or movement towards the glass door.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that there was an action (tugging) involving the glass door.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that there was no action or movement towards the glass door.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If the Premise is true (she tugged at the glass door), then it is impossible for the Hypothesis to be true (she made no motion towards the glass door) because tugging at the door inherently involves making a motion towards it.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,She tugged at the glass door.,She attempted to tug the glass door.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""She tugged at the glass door.""
   - This indicates that the action of tugging at the glass door has already occurred.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""She attempted to tug the glass door.""
   - This suggests that there was an attempt to tug the glass door, but it does not confirm whether the action was completed or not.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise confirms that the action of tugging the glass door was completed.
   - The Hypothesis only suggests an attempt, which implies that the action may or may not have been completed.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise confirms the action was completed, it logically entails that there was at least an attempt to perform the action. Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the correct inference relation is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Thus, the final answer is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He tugged at the puppy's ears.,He had a puppy with long ears.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He tugged at the puppy's ears.""
   - This indicates that there is a puppy and someone (he) is tugging at its ears.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""He had a puppy with long ears.""
   - This suggests that the person (he) possesses a puppy and that the puppy has long ears.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise confirms the existence of a puppy and an action involving its ears.
   - The Hypothesis adds a specific detail about the puppy's ears being long, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the length of the puppy's ears. It only mentions that the person tugged at the ears.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis introduces new information (the length of the ears) that is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the detail about the ears being long, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He tugged at the puppy's ears.,He pushed the puppy's ears.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The action described is ""He tugged at the puppy's ears.""
   - ""Tugged"" implies pulling or giving a sharp pull.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The action described is ""He pushed the puppy's ears.""
   - ""Pushed"" implies applying force in a direction away from oneself or in a specific direction.

3. **Comparison**:
   - ""Tugged"" and ""pushed"" are different actions. Tugging involves pulling, while pushing involves applying force in the opposite direction.
   - The actions are mutually exclusive; one cannot simultaneously tug and push in the same context.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - Since the actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are different and cannot occur simultaneously in the same context, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He tugged at the puppy's ears.,The puppy's ears were tugged by him.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He tugged at the puppy's ears.""
   - This means that a male person (he) performed the action of tugging on the ears of a puppy.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The puppy's ears were tugged by him.""
   - This is a passive construction of the same action described in the Premise. It indicates that the same male person (him) performed the action of tugging on the puppy's ears.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: a male person tugging on the ears of a puppy.
   - The only difference is the grammatical structure: the Premise uses an active voice, while the Hypothesis uses a passive voice.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is simply a rephrasing of the Premise and conveys the exact same information, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

0 – Entailment

The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

conative,partial,"I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.",I tried to break my door down to leave my house.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.""
   - This indicates that the speaker attempted to open the door by kicking it, but the door did not move.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I tried to break my door down to leave my house.""
   - This suggests that the speaker attempted to forcefully open the door with the intention of leaving the house.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions kicking the door, which can be interpreted as an attempt to break it down.
   - The Hypothesis adds the detail that the purpose of breaking the door down was to leave the house, which is not explicitly stated in the Premise.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise must clearly indicate that the speaker was trying to break the door down to leave the house. The Premise does not explicitly state the intention to leave the house.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information about the speaker's intention (leaving the house), but it does not contradict it either.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to indicate that the speaker was not trying to break the door down or had no intention of leaving the house. The Premise does not provide such contradictory information.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.",The door swung open immediately from one kick.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker kicked at the door multiple times (""a couple of times"").
   - Despite these efforts, the door ""didn't budge,"" meaning it did not move or open.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The door ""swung open immediately"" from just ""one kick.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the door did not move at all despite being kicked multiple times.
   - The Hypothesis claims that the door opened immediately with just one kick.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If the door did not budge after multiple kicks, it cannot be true that it swung open immediately from just one kick.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.",The door didn't budge from my multiple kicks at it.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I kicked at the door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.""
   - This means that despite kicking the door multiple times, the door did not move or open.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The door didn't budge from my multiple kicks at it.""
   - This means that the door did not move or open as a result of being kicked multiple times.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same information: the door did not budge despite being kicked multiple times.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a restatement of the Premise in different words.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the information in the Premise, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct numerical value for the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.""
   - This indicates that Henry Edison performed an action involving the tire of an old automobile. However, it does not specify why he kicked the tire or the condition of the tire.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Henry Edison had gotten a flat on his old automobile.""
   - This suggests that the tire on Henry Edison's old automobile was flat.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not provide any explicit information about the condition of the tire. It only mentions that Henry Edison kicked at the tire.
   - The Hypothesis makes a specific claim about the tire being flat, which is not directly supported or refuted by the Premise.

4. **Inference**:
   - Since the Premise does not confirm or deny the condition of the tire, we cannot definitively conclude that the tire was flat based on the information given.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.,Hendy Edison shined his tire on his new automobile.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.""
   - This statement tells us that Henry Edison performed an action (kicking) directed at a tire on an old automobile.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Hendy Edison shined his tire on his new automobile.""
   - This statement tells us that Hendy Edison performed an action (shining) directed at a tire on a new automobile.

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Subject**: The names are slightly different (""Henry Edison"" vs. ""Hendy Edison""). This could be a typo or refer to different individuals.
   - **Action**: The actions are different (""kicked"" vs. ""shined"").
   - **Object**: The objects of the actions are different (""old automobile"" vs. ""new automobile"").

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are different.
   - The objects involved (old automobile vs. new automobile) are different.
   - The slight difference in names could imply different individuals, but even if we assume it's a typo, the actions and objects are still different.

Given these differences, the Hypothesis does not logically follow from the Premise. The Hypothesis introduces new information that is not supported by the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

2 – Contradiction",2 – Contradiction,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.,Henry Edison tried to kick the tire on the old automobile.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Henry Edison kicked at the tire on the old automobile.""
   - This indicates that Henry Edison performed an action directed at the tire of an old automobile. The phrase ""kicked at"" suggests an attempt to kick, but it does not confirm whether the kick was successful or not.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Henry Edison tried to kick the tire on the old automobile.""
   - This suggests that Henry Edison made an effort to kick the tire, but it does not confirm whether the kick was successful or not.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis involve Henry Edison making an effort to kick the tire on the old automobile.
   - The Premise uses ""kicked at,"" which implies an attempt, aligning with the Hypothesis's use of ""tried to kick.""

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis does not add any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Premise supports the idea that Henry Edison made an attempt to kick the tire, which is exactly what the Hypothesis states.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.,Luke tested the durability of the chair with his shoe.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.""
   - This statement describes a specific action: Luke is kicking the chair leg with his boot.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Luke tested the durability of the chair with his shoe.""
   - This statement suggests that Luke's action was intended to test the chair's durability using his shoe.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about Luke's intention or the purpose behind his action. It only states the physical action of kicking the chair leg.
   - The Hypothesis introduces an additional element: the purpose of testing the chair's durability, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must definitively imply that Luke was testing the chair's durability. Since the Premise does not mention any intention or purpose, we cannot conclude this with certainty.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it is not necessarily true. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the purpose behind Luke's action.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly opposes the idea that Luke was testing the chair's durability. The Premise does not provide such contradictory information.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.,Luke pushed the chair away with his tennis shoe.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The action described: ""Luke kicked at the chair leg.""
   - The method of action: ""with the toe of his leather half-boot.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The action described: ""Luke pushed the chair away.""
   - The method of action: ""with his tennis shoe.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Action**: The Premise describes Luke kicking the chair leg, while the Hypothesis describes Luke pushing the chair away. Kicking and pushing are different actions.
   - **Footwear**: The Premise mentions a ""leather half-boot,"" while the Hypothesis mentions a ""tennis shoe."" These are different types of footwear.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions (kicking vs. pushing) and the footwear (leather half-boot vs. tennis shoe) are different in the Premise and Hypothesis.
   - The Hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the Premise. The Premise does not provide information that confirms or denies the action of pushing the chair away with a tennis shoe. It only describes a different action (kicking) with different footwear (leather half-boot).

Given these points, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. There is no direct contradiction, but there is also no entailment.

Therefore, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.,The chair leg was kicked at with Luke's toe of his leather half-boot.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Luke kicked at the chair leg with the toe of his leather half-boot.""
   - This statement tells us that Luke used the toe of his leather half-boot to kick at the chair leg.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The chair leg was kicked at with Luke's toe of his leather half-boot.""
   - This statement indicates that the chair leg was kicked at using the toe of Luke's leather half-boot.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action: the chair leg being kicked at with the toe of Luke's leather half-boot.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the action described in the Premise without changing the meaning or introducing any new information.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and does not introduce any new elements or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He looked down and poked at the keyboard.,He was typing on his computer.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He looked down and poked at the keyboard.""
   - This indicates that the person is interacting with a keyboard, but it does not specify the context or the device to which the keyboard is connected.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""He was typing on his computer.""
   - This suggests that the person is using a computer and actively typing on it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions ""poked at the keyboard,"" which implies some form of interaction with a keyboard but does not explicitly state that the person is typing.
   - The Hypothesis specifies ""typing on his computer,"" which is a more specific action and context (typing and using a computer).

4. **Inference**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true, the Premise would need to clearly indicate that the person is typing on a computer. The Premise only mentions poking at the keyboard, which is not sufficient to confirm typing or the use of a computer.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the Hypothesis. It is possible that the person is typing on a computer, but it is also possible that the keyboard is connected to another device, or the person is not typing at all.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: There is no information in the Premise that directly contradicts the Hypothesis. The Premise does not rule out the possibility that the person is typing on a computer.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is Neutral (1), as the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the Hypothesis.

**Answer**: 1",**Answer**: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He looked down and poked at the keyboard.,He looked up at his computer screen.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He looked down and poked at the keyboard.""
   - This indicates that the person is currently looking down and interacting with the keyboard.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""He looked up at his computer screen.""
   - This suggests that the person is looking up at the computer screen.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an action (looking down and poking at the keyboard) that is different from the action described in the Hypothesis (looking up at the computer screen).
   - These two actions are mutually exclusive in the same moment; one cannot look down and up simultaneously.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis cannot occur at the same time, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

The numerical value corresponding to Contradiction is **2**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He looked down and poked at the keyboard.,He looked down and made poking motions in the direction of the keyboard.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He looked down and poked at the keyboard.""
   - This means that the person directed their gaze downward and physically interacted with the keyboard by poking it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""He looked down and made poking motions in the direction of the keyboard.""
   - This means that the person directed their gaze downward and made motions that resemble poking towards the keyboard, but it does not explicitly state that the person actually touched the keyboard.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that the person poked at the keyboard, implying direct contact.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that the person made poking motions towards the keyboard, which could imply either actual contact or just the motion without contact.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise because making poking motions towards the keyboard can include the action of actually poking it.
   - The Hypothesis is not definitively true based on the Premise because the Premise specifies actual contact, while the Hypothesis allows for the possibility of just the motion without contact.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.,Mary Elizabeth was testing the softness of the potatoes.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.""
   - This indicates that Mary Elizabeth performed an action involving the potatoes, specifically poking them.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Mary Elizabeth was testing the softness of the potatoes.""
   - This suggests that the action of poking the potatoes was done with the intention of testing their softness.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state the reason why Mary Elizabeth poked the potatoes. It only describes the action.
   - The Hypothesis provides a specific reason for the action (testing the softness).

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that Mary Elizabeth was testing the softness of the potatoes. The Premise does not provide this specific information.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it is not definitively supported by the Premise. The action of poking could be for testing softness, but it could also be for other reasons (e.g., checking if they are cooked, moving them around, etc.).
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly conflicts with the idea that Mary Elizabeth was testing the softness of the potatoes. The Premise does not provide any such conflicting information.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the answer is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.,Mary Elizabeth stared at the potatoes but made no move towards them.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that ""Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.""
   - This indicates that Mary Elizabeth took an active action towards the potatoes by jumping up and poking them.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that ""Mary Elizabeth stared at the potatoes but made no move towards them.""
   - This indicates that Mary Elizabeth did not take any action towards the potatoes; she only stared at them without moving.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise describes an active interaction with the potatoes (jumping up and poking).
   - The hypothesis describes a passive interaction with the potatoes (staring without moving).

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The actions described in the premise and the hypothesis are mutually exclusive. If Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes, she cannot simultaneously be staring at them without making any move.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.,The potatoes were poked at as Mary Elizabeth jumped up.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Mary Elizabeth jumped up and poked at the potatoes.""
   - This means that Mary Elizabeth performed two actions: she jumped up and she poked at the potatoes.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The potatoes were poked at as Mary Elizabeth jumped up.""
   - This means that the action of poking at the potatoes occurred while Mary Elizabeth was jumping up.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates two actions: jumping up and poking at the potatoes. It does not specify the exact timing or sequence of these actions relative to each other.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that the poking at the potatoes happened simultaneously with the jumping up.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm that the poking and jumping happened at the same time. It only states that both actions occurred, but it does not specify their temporal relationship.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information given in the Premise. There is no contradiction, but there is also no definite confirmation of simultaneity.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Thus, the final answer is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.,I had a straw in my cold drink.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.""
   - This indicates that the speaker has a drink with ice cubes in it. The action of poking suggests some interaction with the ice cubes, but it does not specify how the poking is done (e.g., with a straw, finger, or another object).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""I had a straw in my cold drink.""
   - This suggests that the speaker's drink is cold (since it has ice cubes) and that the speaker has a straw in the drink.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise confirms the presence of ice cubes, which implies the drink is cold.
   - However, the premise does not provide any information about the presence of a straw. The action of poking at the ice cubes could be done with various objects or even fingers, not necessarily a straw.

4. **Inference**:
   - The hypothesis introduces new information (the presence of a straw) that is not mentioned or implied in the premise.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis may or may not be true based on the given premise. There is no direct contradiction, but there is also no direct support for the presence of a straw.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as Neutral.

Answer: 1",Answer: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.,I left the ice cubes in my drink alone.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.""
   - This indicates an action where the speaker interacted with the ice cubes by poking them.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I left the ice cubes in my drink alone.""
   - This indicates a lack of action where the speaker did not interact with the ice cubes and left them undisturbed.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an action (poking the ice cubes).
   - The Hypothesis describes the absence of action (leaving the ice cubes alone).

4. **Inference**:
   - If the speaker poked the ice cubes (Premise), it directly contradicts the idea that the speaker left the ice cubes alone (Hypothesis).
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

The correct numerical value is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.,I moved around ice cubes in my drink.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I poked at the ice cubes in my drink.""
   - This implies that the speaker interacted with the ice cubes in their drink by poking them.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I moved around ice cubes in my drink.""
   - This implies that the speaker caused the ice cubes to change position within the drink.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Poking at ice cubes can result in them moving around, but it is not necessarily the same as intentionally moving them around. Poking is a specific action that may or may not result in movement.
   - The Hypothesis suggests a broader action (moving around) that could include poking but is not limited to it.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis (""I moved around ice cubes in my drink"") may or may not be true given the Premise (""I poked at the ice cubes in my drink""). Poking could lead to movement, but it is not guaranteed.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is not definitely true (Entailment) nor definitely false (Contradiction) based on the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as Neutral.

**Final Answer**: 1",**Final Answer**: 1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.,Marco had been up very high on a ladder.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.""
   - This indicates that Marco was on a ladder and experienced a loss of balance, prompting him to grab the railing.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Marco had been up very high on a ladder.""
   - This suggests that Marco was at a significant height on the ladder.

3. **Inference Evaluation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be definitely true given the premise, the premise must explicitly or implicitly confirm that Marco was very high on the ladder. The premise only mentions that Marco lost his balance and grabbed the railing, but it does not specify the height at which this occurred.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise does not provide enough information about the height Marco was at. He could have been at any height on the ladder when he lost his balance.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the hypothesis to be definitely false given the premise, the premise would need to indicate that Marco was not high on the ladder. The premise does not provide such information; it does not contradict the possibility that Marco was high on the ladder.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is **Neutral (1)** because the premise does not provide sufficient information to confirm or deny the height Marco was at on the ladder.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.,Marco maintained balance and didn't need the ladder railing.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.""
   - This indicates that Marco was in a situation where he lost his balance and, as a result, he grabbed the ladder railing to presumably regain or maintain his balance.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Marco maintained balance and didn't need the ladder railing.""
   - This suggests that Marco was able to keep his balance and did not require the use of the ladder railing.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise explicitly states that Marco lost his balance and grabbed the ladder railing.
   - The hypothesis claims the opposite: that Marco maintained his balance and did not need the ladder railing.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - Since the premise and the hypothesis present directly opposing situations (losing balance and grabbing the railing vs. maintaining balance and not needing the railing), the hypothesis cannot be true if the premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.,Marco grabbed at the ladder railing as he lost his balance.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Marco lost his balance and grabbed at the ladder railing.""
   - This statement indicates two events: Marco losing his balance and then grabbing at the ladder railing.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Marco grabbed at the ladder railing as he lost his balance.""
   - This statement suggests that Marco grabbed the ladder railing simultaneously as he lost his balance.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that Marco lost his balance and then grabbed the ladder railing, implying a sequence of events.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that the grabbing of the ladder railing happened at the same time as losing balance, implying simultaneity.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state that the grabbing and losing balance happened simultaneously, but it does not contradict it either. It is possible that Marco grabbed the railing immediately as he lost his balance.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it is not definitively true based on the information provided.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Thus, the final answer is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.,I tried to fix the springs in the toy.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.""
   - This statement describes an action where the speaker is applying pressure to springs using their hands. It does not provide any context about the purpose of this action.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I tried to fix the springs in the toy.""
   - This statement suggests that the speaker's action was an attempt to repair or adjust springs that are part of a toy.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not specify the reason for pushing the springs. It only describes the action itself.
   - The Hypothesis adds additional context by suggesting a purpose for the action (fixing springs in a toy).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the action was an attempt to fix springs in a toy. The Premise does not provide this specific context.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true given the Premise, but it is not necessarily true. The Premise does not rule out the possibility that the action was an attempt to fix springs in a toy, but it also does not confirm it.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly conflicts with the idea of fixing springs in a toy. The Premise does not provide any such conflicting information.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the answer is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.,I released the springs with the tips of my fingers.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.""
   - This indicates an action where the subject is applying force to the springs using the palms of their hands.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I released the springs with the tips of my fingers.""
   - This indicates a different action where the subject is letting go of the springs using the tips of their fingers.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are different: pushing versus releasing.
   - The body parts used are also different: palms of hands versus tips of fingers.
   - There is no direct logical connection that implies one action from the other. Pushing the springs does not necessarily mean that the springs will be released, nor does it imply the use of fingers.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: The Hypothesis would need to be a direct logical consequence of the Premise. This is not the case here.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true or false independently of the Premise. There is no information in the Premise that confirms or denies the action in the Hypothesis.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The Hypothesis would need to be logically impossible given the Premise. This is not the case here either, as pushing the springs does not preclude releasing them with fingers.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is Neutral (1), as the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

**Final Answer**:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.,I pushed the palms of my hands against the springs.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I pushed at the springs with the palms of my hands.""
   - This sentence indicates that the action of pushing is directed at the springs and the part of the body used for pushing is the palms of the hands.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I pushed the palms of my hands against the springs.""
   - This sentence indicates that the palms of the hands are being pushed against the springs.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both sentences describe a similar action involving pushing and the use of palms against springs.
   - The direction and the objects involved in the action are consistent between the two sentences.
   - The slight difference in wording (""pushed at"" vs. ""pushed against"") does not change the overall meaning of the action being described.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because it describes the same action with the same objects involved.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or adds uncertainty to the action described in the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.,His belly pushed at the buttons of the hotel elevator through his shirt.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.""
   - This means that the person's belly is pressing against the buttons of his shirt, which is described as white and blue and an Aloha shirt.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""His belly pushed at the buttons of the hotel elevator through his shirt.""
   - This suggests that the person's belly is pressing against the buttons of a hotel elevator, and this action is happening through his shirt.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes the belly pushing against the buttons of the shirt itself.
   - The Hypothesis describes the belly pushing against the buttons of a hotel elevator, with the shirt being an intermediary.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about a hotel elevator or the belly pushing against anything other than the shirt's buttons.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new element (hotel elevator buttons) that is not mentioned in the Premise.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is not directly supported by the Premise, nor is it contradicted by it. The Premise simply does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Thus, the final answer is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.,The white and blue Aloha shirt hung on his thin frame.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.""
   - This indicates that the person is wearing a white and blue Aloha shirt that is tight around his belly, suggesting that he has a larger or fuller belly.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The white and blue Aloha shirt hung on his thin frame.""
   - This suggests that the person is wearing a white and blue Aloha shirt that is loose and hangs on his body, implying that he has a thin frame.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes the shirt as being tight around a larger belly.
   - The Hypothesis describes the shirt as being loose on a thin frame.

4. **Inference**:
   - The descriptions of the person's body in the Premise and the Hypothesis are contradictory. The Premise suggests a larger body (belly pushing at the buttons), while the Hypothesis suggests a thin body (shirt hanging loosely).

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because the physical descriptions of the person's body are mutually exclusive.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.,The white and blue Aloha shirt buttons stretched over his belly.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""His belly pushed at the buttons of his white and blue Aloha shirt.""
   - This indicates that the person's belly is exerting pressure on the buttons of the shirt, suggesting that the shirt is tight around the belly area.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The white and blue Aloha shirt buttons stretched over his belly.""
   - This suggests that the buttons of the shirt are being stretched due to the belly, implying that the shirt is tight around the belly area.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a situation where the shirt is tight around the belly.
   - The Premise uses the phrase ""pushed at the buttons,"" while the Hypothesis uses ""stretched over his belly."" Both phrases convey a similar meaning: the shirt is tight and the buttons are under strain due to the belly.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given that both statements describe the same situation (a tight shirt with buttons under strain due to the belly), the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0 – Entailment

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He pushed at the doorbell.,He wanted to see if someone was home.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He pushed at the doorbell.""
   - This action suggests that someone is interacting with a doorbell, which is typically used to alert someone inside a building of the presence of a visitor.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""He wanted to see if someone was home.""
   - This statement suggests a motivation behind the action of pushing the doorbell, implying that the person is trying to determine if there is someone inside the building.

3. **Inference Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the action described in the Premise must definitively imply the motivation described in the Hypothesis. In this case, pushing a doorbell does not necessarily mean the person wants to see if someone is home; there could be other reasons for pushing the doorbell (e.g., delivering a package, playing a prank, etc.).
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. Pushing a doorbell could be motivated by wanting to see if someone is home, but it is not the only possible motivation. Therefore, the Hypothesis is plausible but not certain.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the action described in the Premise must make the motivation described in the Hypothesis impossible. In this case, there is no information in the Premise that directly contradicts the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relationship is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He pushed at the doorbell.,He hovered over the doorbell.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He pushed at the doorbell.""
   - This indicates that the person made physical contact with the doorbell and applied force to it, typically to ring it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""He hovered over the doorbell.""
   - This suggests that the person was near the doorbell, possibly with their hand close to it, but did not make physical contact or apply force to it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The action described in the Premise (pushing the doorbell) involves direct physical interaction.
   - The action described in the Hypothesis (hovering over the doorbell) involves being close to the doorbell without making contact.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the action of pushing the doorbell must imply that the person also hovered over it. However, pushing the doorbell does not necessarily mean the person hovered over it beforehand.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be true or false given the Premise. It is possible that before pushing the doorbell, the person hovered over it, but it is not a certainty.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the action of pushing the doorbell must make it impossible for the person to have hovered over it. However, these actions are not mutually exclusive; one could hover over the doorbell before pushing it.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the final answer is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He pushed at the doorbell.,The doorbell was pushed at by him.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""He pushed at the doorbell.""
   - This means that a male individual applied force to the doorbell.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The doorbell was pushed at by him.""
   - This is a passive construction of the same action described in the Premise. It means that the doorbell received the action of being pushed by the same male individual.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: a male individual pushing at the doorbell.
   - The only difference is the grammatical structure: the Premise uses an active voice, while the Hypothesis uses a passive voice.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is simply a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the exact same information, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.",I had a mark on my body I needed to wash off.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information provided in both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.""
   - This indicates that the speaker used a washcloth to rub at a mark. The action of wetting the washcloth and rubbing suggests an attempt to clean or remove the mark.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""I had a mark on my body I needed to wash off.""
   - This suggests that the mark was on the speaker's body and that there was a need to wash it off.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise does not explicitly state where the mark is located. It only mentions that the speaker rubbed at the mark with a wet washcloth.
   - The hypothesis specifies that the mark is on the speaker's body and that there was a need to wash it off.

4. **Inference**:
   - The premise supports the idea that there was a mark that needed to be cleaned, but it does not provide enough information to confirm that the mark was specifically on the speaker's body.
   - Therefore, while the hypothesis is plausible given the premise, it is not definitively confirmed by the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Thus, the final answer is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.",I took a dry washcloth and hovered over the mark.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.""
   - This indicates that the washcloth was wet and that an action was performed (rubbing) on the mark.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I took a dry washcloth and hovered over the mark.""
   - This indicates that the washcloth was dry and that no direct contact (rubbing) was made with the mark, only hovering over it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the washcloth was wet, while the Hypothesis states that the washcloth was dry. These two conditions cannot both be true simultaneously for the same washcloth at the same time.
   - The Premise states that the action performed was rubbing at the mark, while the Hypothesis states that the action was hovering over the mark. These actions are different and cannot both be true simultaneously for the same event.

Given these points, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise in terms of both the state of the washcloth (wet vs. dry) and the action performed (rubbing vs. hovering).

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.",I rubbed at the mark with a wet washcloth.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the content step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I took a washcloth and wet it, then rubbed at the mark.""
   - This sentence describes a sequence of actions: first, taking a washcloth, then wetting it, and finally rubbing at a mark.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I rubbed at the mark with a wet washcloth.""
   - This sentence describes the action of rubbing at a mark using a wet washcloth.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis states that the action of rubbing at the mark was done with a wet washcloth.
   - The Premise provides a detailed sequence leading to the same action: taking a washcloth, wetting it, and then rubbing at the mark.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is a simplified version of the Premise, focusing on the final action and the condition of the washcloth (wet).
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis must be true because the Premise explicitly states that the washcloth was wet before rubbing at the mark.

Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

The correct relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.,He had a fresh bite on his neck.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.""
   - Key points: 
     - There is a bite wound.
     - The wound is described as ""raw,"" which implies it is fresh or recent.
     - The location of the wound is on his throat.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He had a fresh bite on his neck.""
   - Key points:
     - There is a bite.
     - The bite is described as ""fresh.""
     - The location of the bite is on his neck.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention a bite wound.
   - The Premise describes the wound as ""raw,"" which is synonymous with ""fresh.""
   - The location in the Premise is ""throat,"" while the Hypothesis mentions ""neck."" The throat is part of the neck, so this is consistent.

4. **Inference**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because:
     - The description of the wound as ""raw"" in the Premise supports the ""fresh"" description in the Hypothesis.
     - The location ""throat"" in the Premise is a specific part of the ""neck"" mentioned in the Hypothesis.

Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

The relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.,His rubbing came nowhere close to the raw bite wound on his throat.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.""
   - This means that the action of rubbing is directly applied to the raw bite wound on his throat.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""His rubbing came nowhere close to the raw bite wound on his throat.""
   - This means that the action of rubbing did not come near the raw bite wound on his throat.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates that the rubbing is directly on the raw bite wound.
   - The hypothesis indicates that the rubbing did not come near the raw bite wound.

4. **Inference**:
   - The two statements are directly contradictory. The premise says the rubbing is on the wound, while the hypothesis says the rubbing is not near the wound.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.,His throat had a raw bite wound he rubbed at.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat.""
   - This sentence tells us that there is a person (he) who is rubbing a raw bite wound located on his throat.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""His throat had a raw bite wound he rubbed at.""
   - This sentence states that there is a raw bite wound on his throat, and he is rubbing it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same situation: a person rubbing a raw bite wound on his throat.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis restates the information provided in the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I rubbed at the ache in my neck.,I slept on my neck wrong.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I rubbed at the ache in my neck.""
   - This indicates that the speaker is experiencing some discomfort or pain in their neck and is trying to alleviate it by rubbing.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I slept on my neck wrong.""
   - This suggests a possible cause for the neck ache, implying that the discomfort is due to an incorrect sleeping position.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must definitively imply that the neck ache is due to sleeping wrong. However, the Premise only mentions the presence of an ache and does not provide any information about its cause.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis could be a possible explanation for the neck ache, but it is not the only possible explanation. The Premise does not confirm or deny the cause of the ache, leaving room for multiple interpretations.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly conflicts with the idea that the neck ache is due to sleeping wrong. Since the Premise does not provide any such conflicting information, this relation does not apply.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is Neutral (1), as the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise.

**Final Answer**:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I rubbed at the ache in my neck.,I didn't touch my alleviated neck.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I rubbed at the ache in my neck.""
   - This indicates that the speaker performed an action (rubbing) on their neck, which was aching.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I didn't touch my alleviated neck.""
   - This indicates that the speaker did not touch their neck, which is described as alleviated (meaning the ache has been relieved).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an action (rubbing) that involves touching the neck.
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states that the speaker did not touch their neck.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the speaker rubbed their neck (Premise), it directly contradicts the statement that they did not touch their neck (Hypothesis).
   - The description of the neck as ""alleviated"" in the Hypothesis does not affect the contradiction because the key point is the action of touching or not touching the neck.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,I rubbed at the ache in my neck.,I had an ache in my neck I rubbed at.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I rubbed at the ache in my neck.""
   - This indicates that the speaker had an ache in their neck and they took the action of rubbing it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I had an ache in my neck I rubbed at.""
   - This indicates that the speaker had an ache in their neck and they took the action of rubbing it.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same situation: the speaker had an ache in their neck and they rubbed it.
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with the same meaning.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they describe the same event), the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.,Lily was wearing a decorated dress.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.""
   - This indicates that Lily's dress has ribbons on it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Lily was wearing a decorated dress.""
   - A decorated dress typically means a dress that has some form of adornment or embellishment.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions that Lily's dress has ribbons, which are a form of decoration.
   - Therefore, if Lily's dress has ribbons, it can be inferred that her dress is decorated.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given that the presence of ribbons on Lily's dress directly supports the idea that her dress is decorated, the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the information provided in the Premise.

Thus, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

Answer: 0",Answer: 0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.,Lily made no attempt to touch the ribbons on her dress.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.""
   - This means that Lily interacted with the ribbons on her dress by plucking at them.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Lily made no attempt to touch the ribbons on her dress.""
   - This means that Lily did not try to touch the ribbons on her dress at all.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that Lily did touch the ribbons (by plucking at them).
   - The Hypothesis claims that Lily did not touch the ribbons.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. If Lily plucked at the ribbons, she must have touched them, which means the statement that she made no attempt to touch the ribbons cannot be true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.,There were ribbons on Lily's dress she plucked at.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Lily plucked at the ribbons on her dress.""
   - This indicates that Lily was interacting with ribbons that were on her dress.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""There were ribbons on Lily's dress she plucked at.""
   - This suggests that there were ribbons on Lily's dress, and she was plucking at them.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly mentions that Lily was plucking at ribbons on her dress.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases this information, stating that there were ribbons on Lily's dress that she plucked at.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The information in the Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise in a different wording.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He stabbed at the last part of the equation.,The last part of the equation was the most complex.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He stabbed at the last part of the equation.""
   - This suggests that someone made an attempt or effort to solve or address the last part of an equation. The use of ""stabbed"" implies a possibly hasty or uncertain attempt, but it does not provide any information about the complexity of the equation.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The last part of the equation was the most complex.""
   - This statement asserts that the last part of the equation is the most complex part compared to other parts of the equation.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise must provide clear evidence that the last part of the equation is the most complex. The Premise does not provide any information about the complexity of the equation.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not give any information about the complexity of the last part of the equation, so it is possible that the last part is the most complex, but it is also possible that it is not.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely false given the Premise, the Premise would need to provide information that directly contradicts the complexity of the last part of the equation. The Premise does not provide any such information.

Given that the Premise does not provide any information about the complexity of the last part of the equation, the Hypothesis may or may not be true.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,He stabbed at the last part of the equation.,He drew attention away from the last part of the equation.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He stabbed at the last part of the equation.""
   - This suggests that the person made an attempt to address or solve the last part of the equation, possibly in a forceful or focused manner.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He drew attention away from the last part of the equation.""
   - This suggests that the person diverted focus or attention away from the last part of the equation.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates an action directed towards the last part of the equation, implying engagement or focus on it.
   - The Hypothesis indicates an action that diverts attention away from the last part of the equation, implying a lack of focus on it.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are directly opposed to each other. Engaging with the last part of the equation (stabbing at it) is incompatible with drawing attention away from it.
   - Therefore, if the Premise is true (he focused on the last part of the equation), the Hypothesis (he diverted attention away from it) cannot be true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He stabbed at the last part of the equation.,He made a stabbing gesture towards the last part of the equation.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He stabbed at the last part of the equation.""
   - This statement indicates that ""he"" performed a stabbing action directed at the last part of the equation. The verb ""stabbed"" suggests a physical action that could be literal or metaphorical.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He made a stabbing gesture towards the last part of the equation.""
   - This statement specifies that ""he"" made a gesture that mimics stabbing, directed at the last part of the equation. The phrase ""stabbing gesture"" implies a non-literal action, more of a mimicking or symbolic action rather than an actual stabbing.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise uses the verb ""stabbed,"" which can be interpreted as a literal action or a metaphorical one.
   - The Hypothesis clarifies that the action was a ""stabbing gesture,"" which is explicitly non-literal and indicates a mimicking action.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - If we interpret ""stabbed"" in the Premise as a literal action, then the Hypothesis, which describes a gesture, would not be a direct entailment.
   - If we interpret ""stabbed"" in the Premise as a metaphorical action, then the Hypothesis could be seen as a more detailed description of the same action.

Given the ambiguity in the interpretation of ""stabbed"" in the Premise, the Hypothesis may or may not be true depending on whether ""stabbed"" is taken literally or metaphorically.

Therefore, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.,I tried to drink the last bits of the slushee with my straw.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the content of both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""I took the plastic dome from my drink"": This indicates that the speaker removed the plastic cover from their drink.
   - ""and stabbed at the slush with the straw"": This suggests that the speaker used the straw to poke or stir the slush inside the drink.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I tried to drink the last bits of the slushee with my straw"": This implies that the speaker attempted to consume the remaining portions of the slushee using a straw.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an action involving a drink with slush and a straw, specifically removing the dome and stabbing at the slush.
   - The Hypothesis describes an attempt to drink the remaining slushee with a straw.

4. **Inference**:
   - The action of ""stabbing at the slush with the straw"" in the Premise can reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to consume the slush, which aligns with the Hypothesis's claim of trying to drink the last bits of the slushee.
   - There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the Hypothesis. Instead, the Premise supports the idea that the speaker was engaging with the slush in a way that could be interpreted as trying to drink it.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.,I kept the lid on my drink and slurped the slush with my straw.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""I took the plastic dome from my drink"": This indicates that the speaker removed the lid from their drink.
   - ""and stabbed at the slush with the straw"": This suggests that the speaker used the straw to poke or mix the slush.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""I kept the lid on my drink"": This indicates that the speaker did not remove the lid from their drink.
   - ""and slurped the slush with my straw"": This suggests that the speaker used the straw to drink the slush.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise states that the lid was removed from the drink.
   - The Hypothesis states that the lid was kept on the drink.

4. **Inference:**
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis regarding the lid are directly contradictory. The Premise says the lid was removed, while the Hypothesis says the lid was kept on.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.,I stabbed at the slush with the straw after I took the lid off my drink.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information provided in both statements:

### Premise:
- ""I took the plastic dome from my drink and stabbed at the slush with the straw.""

### Hypothesis:
- ""I stabbed at the slush with the straw after I took the lid off my drink.""

### Analysis:
1. **Action Sequence**:
   - Premise: The sequence of actions is ""took the plastic dome from my drink"" followed by ""stabbed at the slush with the straw.""
   - Hypothesis: The sequence of actions is ""stabbed at the slush with the straw"" after ""I took the lid off my drink.""

2. **Terminology**:
   - ""Plastic dome"" in the Premise is synonymous with ""lid"" in the Hypothesis.

3. **Temporal Order**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of actions: first removing the lid (plastic dome) and then stabbing at the slush with the straw.

### Conclusion:
- The Hypothesis accurately reflects the sequence of actions described in the Premise.
- There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or adds uncertainty to the actions described in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

### Final Decision:

conative,partial,"She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.","She enjoyed a cup of hot coffee, as it warmed her face and hands.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information provided in each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""She took the cup and sipped at the coffee"": This indicates that she is drinking coffee.
   - ""closing her eyes and breathing in the steam"": This suggests she is savoring the experience, possibly enjoying it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She enjoyed a cup of hot coffee"": This suggests she found pleasure in drinking the coffee.
   - ""as it warmed her face and hands"": This implies the coffee was hot and provided warmth to her face and hands.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state that the coffee was hot, but the mention of ""breathing in the steam"" strongly implies it was hot.
   - The Premise does not explicitly state that she enjoyed the coffee, but ""closing her eyes"" while sipping suggests a positive experience, which can be interpreted as enjoyment.
   - The Premise does not mention the coffee warming her face and hands, but it is a reasonable inference given that hot coffee typically provides warmth.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is not definitively true based on the Premise alone because the Premise does not explicitly confirm the enjoyment or the warming effect on her face and hands.
   - However, the Hypothesis is also not contradicted by the Premise. The details in the Premise are consistent with the Hypothesis, making it plausible.

Given these points, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.","She took the cold cup and didn't drink it, realizing her coffee was cold.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""She took the cup and sipped at the coffee"": This indicates that she drank some of the coffee.
   - ""closing her eyes and breathing in the steam"": This suggests that the coffee is hot, as steam is typically associated with hot liquids.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""She took the cold cup"": This suggests that the cup is cold, which contradicts the idea of steam rising from the coffee.
   - ""didn't drink it, realizing her coffee was cold"": This directly contradicts the premise where she sipped the coffee and enjoyed the steam, indicating it was hot.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise states that she sipped the coffee and enjoyed the steam, implying the coffee was hot.
   - The Hypothesis states that the cup was cold and she didn't drink the coffee because it was cold.

Given these points, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise describes a scenario where the coffee is hot and she drinks it, while the Hypothesis describes a scenario where the coffee is cold and she does not drink it.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.","She took the cup and closed her eyes, as she breathed in the steam of her cup of coffee she was sipping.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""She took the cup and sipped at the coffee, closing her eyes and breathing in the steam.""
   - Key actions: 
     - She took the cup.
     - She sipped at the coffee.
     - She closed her eyes.
     - She breathed in the steam.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""She took the cup and closed her eyes, as she breathed in the steam of her cup of coffee she was sipping.""
   - Key actions:
     - She took the cup.
     - She closed her eyes.
     - She breathed in the steam.
     - She was sipping the coffee.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of actions: taking the cup, sipping the coffee, closing her eyes, and breathing in the steam.
   - The order of actions is slightly different, but the essential actions and their relationships are the same.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not omit any critical information that would make it less certain than the Premise.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because it describes the same scenario with the same actions, even though the wording is slightly different.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,I sipped at the Heineken.,I had a bottle of beer.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I sipped at the Heineken.""
   - This indicates that the speaker consumed some amount of Heineken, which is a brand of beer.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I had a bottle of beer.""
   - This suggests that the speaker possessed and consumed a bottle of beer.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise specifies the act of sipping Heineken, but it does not explicitly mention the form in which the Heineken was consumed (e.g., bottle, can, glass).
   - The Hypothesis specifies that the beer was in a bottle.

4. **Inference**:
   - From the Premise, we know that the speaker consumed Heineken, which is beer. However, the Premise does not provide enough information to confirm that the beer was specifically in a bottle.
   - Therefore, while it is possible that the Heineken was in a bottle, it is not definitively stated in the Premise.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The Hypothesis ""I had a bottle of beer"" may or may not be true given the Premise ""I sipped at the Heineken."" The form in which the Heineken was consumed is not specified, so we cannot definitively confirm or deny the Hypothesis based on the given information.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I sipped at the Heineken.,I spit out the Heineken.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I sipped at the Heineken.""
   - This means that the speaker took a small amount of Heineken into their mouth.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I spit out the Heineken.""
   - This means that the speaker expelled the Heineken from their mouth.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The act of sipping (taking a small amount into the mouth) does not necessarily imply that the person will spit it out.
   - Conversely, spitting out the Heineken does not necessarily imply that the person did not sip it first. In fact, one would typically need to sip or take the Heineken into their mouth before they can spit it out.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis (""I spit out the Heineken"") does not directly follow from the Premise (""I sipped at the Heineken""). The Premise does not provide enough information to conclude that the Heineken was spit out.
   - However, the Hypothesis is not in direct contradiction to the Premise either. It is possible that after sipping, the person could have spit it out, but it is not a certainty.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as **Neutral** because the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,I sipped at the Heineken.,I had some Heineken.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I sipped at the Heineken.""
   - This means that the speaker took a sip of Heineken, which implies that they had some amount of Heineken.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I had some Heineken.""
   - This means that the speaker consumed some amount of Heineken, but it does not specify how much or in what manner.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The act of sipping Heineken (as stated in the Premise) directly implies that the speaker had some Heineken. Sipping is a form of consuming, and thus, if someone sipped Heineken, they indeed had some Heineken.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given that the act of sipping Heineken (Premise) directly supports the statement that the speaker had some Heineken (Hypothesis), the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

0 – Entailment

So, the final answer is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.,He toasted together with everyone using glasses of champagne.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.""
   - This indicates that the subject (he) participated in an activity involving raising a glass and sipping champagne, and this action was done in the company of others.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He toasted together with everyone using glasses of champagne.""
   - This suggests that the subject (he) participated in a toast with others, and the toast involved glasses of champagne.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis involve the subject (he) participating in an activity with others.
   - Both statements involve the use of glasses of champagne.
   - The act of raising a glass and sipping champagne (Premise) is closely related to the act of toasting (Hypothesis), as toasting typically involves raising a glass and often sipping from it afterward.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly mention a toast, but raising a glass and sipping champagne in a group setting strongly implies a toast.
   - There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the Hypothesis.
   - The Hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the Premise, as the actions described in the Premise are consistent with the actions typically involved in a toast.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.,He lowered his glass and didn't sip the champagne with everyone else.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.""
   - This indicates that the subject (he) performed two actions: raising his glass and sipping champagne, and that these actions were done in the company of others who were presumably doing the same.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""He lowered his glass and didn't sip the champagne with everyone else.""
   - This indicates that the subject (he) performed two different actions: lowering his glass and not sipping champagne, and that these actions were done in contrast to what everyone else was doing.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise states that he raised his glass and sipped champagne.
   - The Hypothesis states that he lowered his glass and did not sip champagne.
   - These actions are directly opposite to each other. Raising a glass is the opposite of lowering a glass, and sipping champagne is the opposite of not sipping champagne.

4. **Inference Determination:**
   - Since the actions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict the actions described in the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

The correct numerical value is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.,"With everyone else, he tasted the champagne and raised his glass.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He raised his glass and sipped at the champagne with everyone else.""
   - This sentence indicates two actions performed by ""he"": raising his glass and sipping champagne. It also specifies that these actions were done ""with everyone else.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""With everyone else, he tasted the champagne and raised his glass.""
   - This sentence also indicates two actions performed by ""he"": tasting the champagne and raising his glass. It specifies that these actions were done ""with everyone else.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same two actions: raising the glass and consuming champagne.
   - The order of actions is slightly different, but the order does not affect the truth of the actions themselves.
   - Both sentences include the context ""with everyone else,"" indicating that the actions were performed in a group setting.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis are consistent with those in the Premise.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis must be true because it describes the same scenario with the same actions.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

conative,partial,Phil nibbled at the cake.,Phil was too full for cake.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Phil nibbled at the cake.""
   - This means that Phil ate a small amount of cake.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Phil was too full for cake.""
   - This implies that Phil was so full that he could not eat any cake.

3. **Comparison**:
   - If Phil nibbled at the cake, it indicates that he did eat some cake, even if it was just a small amount.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that Phil was too full to eat any cake at all.

4. **Inference**:
   - The action of nibbling at the cake (Premise) directly contradicts the state of being too full to eat any cake (Hypothesis).
   - Therefore, if Phil nibbled at the cake, it cannot be true that he was too full for cake.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Phil nibbled at the cake.,Phil didn't try the cake.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Phil nibbled at the cake.""
   - This means that Phil took small bites of the cake, indicating that he did indeed try the cake.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Phil didn't try the cake.""
   - This means that Phil did not taste or eat any part of the cake.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that Phil did try the cake by nibbling at it.
   - The Hypothesis states the opposite, that Phil did not try the cake.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise and the Hypothesis are directly contradictory (one states that Phil tried the cake, and the other states that he did not), the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Phil nibbled at the cake.,Phil ate some cake.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Phil nibbled at the cake.""
   - ""Nibbled"" implies that Phil took small bites of the cake. It does not specify the quantity of cake consumed but indicates that some amount of cake was eaten, even if it was just a small portion.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Phil ate some cake.""
   - ""Ate some cake"" implies that Phil consumed a portion of the cake. The term ""some"" is vague but generally means that a non-zero amount of cake was eaten.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise (""Phil nibbled at the cake"") suggests that Phil ate a small amount of cake.
   - The Hypothesis (""Phil ate some cake"") suggests that Phil ate a portion of the cake, which aligns with the idea of nibbling (eating small amounts).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given that nibbling at the cake involves eating at least a small amount of it, the Hypothesis (""Phil ate some cake"") is definitely true if the Premise (""Phil nibbled at the cake"") is true.
   - There is no information in the Premise that contradicts the Hypothesis, nor is there any ambiguity that would make the Hypothesis only possibly true.

Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

The relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.",He didn't realize how hungry he was for food.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.""
   - This suggests that the person initially ate slowly or cautiously (nibbled) but then proceeded to eat with great enthusiasm and hunger (ravenously).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He didn't realize how hungry he was for food.""
   - This implies that the person was unaware of their own hunger until they started eating.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes a change in eating behavior from nibbling to eating ravenously, which can imply that the person might have been hungrier than they initially thought.
   - The Hypothesis states explicitly that the person didn't realize their own hunger.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise does not directly state the person's awareness of their hunger, but the described behavior (nibbling then eating ravenously) can reasonably suggest that the person might not have realized how hungry they were initially.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is a plausible explanation of the behavior described in the Premise, but it is not definitively confirmed by it.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise. There is no direct contradiction, nor is there a definite confirmation.

Thus, the relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.","He took big bites of the filet, then slowed down.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.""
   - This indicates that the person started by eating small bites (nibbling) and then transitioned to eating very eagerly and in large amounts (ravenously).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""He took big bites of the filet, then slowed down.""
   - This suggests that the person started by eating large bites and then transitioned to eating more slowly.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise describes a progression from small bites to eating eagerly and in large amounts.
   - The Hypothesis describes a progression from large bites to eating more slowly.

4. **Inference:**
   - The two descriptions are opposite in terms of the eating behavior progression. The Premise indicates an increase in eating intensity, while the Hypothesis indicates a decrease in eating intensity.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise because the sequences of actions are contradictory.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

2 – Contradiction

So, the final answer is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.","He ate ravenously, after small bites of the filet.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information provided in both statements:

### Premise:
- ""He nibbled at the filet, then ate ravenously.""
  - This indicates two actions in sequence:
    1. He nibbled at the filet.
    2. He ate ravenously.

### Hypothesis:
- ""He ate ravenously, after small bites of the filet.""
  - This also indicates two actions in sequence:
    1. He took small bites of the filet.
    2. He ate ravenously.

### Analysis:
1. **Sequence of Actions**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of actions: first, small bites (nibbled), then eating ravenously.
   
2. **Terminology**:
   - ""Nibbled"" and ""small bites"" are synonymous, meaning they convey the same action.
   - The phrase ""then ate ravenously"" in the Premise is equivalent to ""ate ravenously, after"" in the Hypothesis. Both indicate that the ravenous eating happened after the small bites.

### Conclusion:
- The Hypothesis restates the sequence of actions described in the Premise using slightly different wording but maintains the same meaning.
- Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

### Final Decision:
- The relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Entailment**.

conative,partial,"He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.","She had worn lipstick that day, not knowing she would be kissed.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""He kissed her in return"" implies that there was an initial kiss from her.
   - ""then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind"" indicates that she was wearing lipstick, and it left a mark on him.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""She had worn lipstick that day"" is consistent with the premise, as the premise mentions lipstick being left behind.
   - ""not knowing she would be kissed"" introduces an additional detail about her state of mind or expectations.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The premise confirms that she was wearing lipstick.
   - The hypothesis adds a detail about her not knowing she would be kissed, which is not addressed in the premise.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - The hypothesis is partially supported by the premise (she wore lipstick), but the additional detail about her not knowing she would be kissed is not confirmed or denied by the premise.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,"He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.",He didn't touch her because of the lipstick she had that would smear on him.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""He kissed her in return"" indicates that there was a mutual act of kissing.
   - ""then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind"" suggests that after the kiss, he noticed the lipstick mark she left and attempted to remove it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""He didn't touch her because of the lipstick she had that would smear on him"" implies that he avoided physical contact with her due to the presence of lipstick that could transfer onto him.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise clearly states that he did kiss her and then dealt with the lipstick mark afterward.
   - The Hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that he avoided touching her entirely because of the lipstick.

4. **Inference Determination:**
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise describes an action (kissing) that the Hypothesis denies (not touching her).

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"He kissed her in return, then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind.","He wiped at the lipstick he knew she had left behind, after he had kissed her in return.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He kissed her in return"" indicates that there was an initial kiss from her, and he reciprocated.
   - ""then brushed at the lipstick he knew she had left behind"" suggests that after kissing her, he noticed and attempted to remove the lipstick she left on him.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He wiped at the lipstick he knew she had left behind"" suggests he attempted to remove the lipstick she left on him.
   - ""after he had kissed her in return"" indicates that this action of wiping the lipstick occurred after he reciprocated her kiss.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of events: he kissed her in return, and then he tried to remove the lipstick she left behind.
   - The actions described in both the Premise and the Hypothesis are identical in terms of sequence and content.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise with no change in meaning or sequence of events, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

conative,partial,"He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.",She had long hair past her shoulders that he moved away.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information provided in both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He studied her face"" indicates that a male subject is observing a female subject's face.
   - ""brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders"" suggests that the female subject has hair that falls over her shoulders, and the male subject is brushing it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""She had long hair past her shoulders"" implies that the female subject's hair extends beyond her shoulders.
   - ""that he moved away"" suggests that the male subject moved the hair away.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the hair ""tumbled over her shoulders,"" which implies that the hair is long enough to reach or go past her shoulders.
   - The Hypothesis states that the hair is ""long hair past her shoulders,"" which is consistent with the description in the Premise.
   - The action of ""brushed at the hair"" in the Premise can be reasonably interpreted as ""moved away"" in the Hypothesis.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is consistent with the information given in the Premise. The description of the hair and the action taken by the male subject align well between the two statements.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
conative,partial,"He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.",He didn't look her in the face or touch her hair that tumbled over her shoulders.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He studied her face"" indicates that he looked at her face.
   - ""brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders"" indicates that he touched her hair.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He didn't look her in the face"" directly contradicts ""He studied her face"" from the premise.
   - ""or touch her hair that tumbled over her shoulders"" directly contradicts ""brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders"" from the premise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis states that he did not perform actions (looking at her face and touching her hair) that the Premise explicitly states he did.
   - This creates a direct contradiction between the Premise and the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

The correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,"He studied her face, brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders.","As he studied her face, he made a brushing movement at the hair tumbling over her shoulders.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He studied her face"" indicates that he is observing her face closely.
   - ""brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders"" indicates that he made a brushing movement at her hair which is falling over her shoulders.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""As he studied her face"" suggests that the action of studying her face is happening simultaneously with another action.
   - ""he made a brushing movement at the hair tumbling over her shoulders"" indicates that he is making a brushing movement at her hair which is falling over her shoulders.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe two actions: studying her face and making a brushing movement at her hair.
   - The sequence and nature of the actions are consistent between the Premise and the Hypothesis.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but does not introduce any new information or contradict the given information.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and does not add or contradict any information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

conative,partial,Someone hammered at the front door.,Someone was trying to get in the house.,1,"To determine the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Someone hammered at the front door.""
   - This means that there was a person who was making a loud noise by hitting the front door.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Someone was trying to get in the house.""
   - This implies that a person was attempting to enter the house.

3. **Evaluating the Relationship**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the act of hammering at the front door must necessarily imply that the person was trying to get into the house. However, hammering at the door could be for various reasons, such as trying to get someone's attention, knocking loudly, or even causing damage without the intent to enter.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. Hammering at the front door could be an attempt to get into the house, but it is not the only possible reason for hammering. Therefore, the Hypothesis is plausible but not certain.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the act of hammering at the front door must imply that the person was definitely not trying to get into the house. This is not the case, as hammering could still be an attempt to enter.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relationship is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
conative,partial,Someone hammered at the front door.,Someone didn't touch the front door.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Someone hammered at the front door.""
   - This implies that there was physical contact with the front door, specifically hammering.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Someone didn't touch the front door.""
   - This implies that there was no physical contact with the front door.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that there was physical contact with the front door (hammering).
   - The Hypothesis indicates that there was no physical contact with the front door.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise because if someone hammered at the front door, it is impossible for it to be true that no one touched the front door.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
conative,partial,Someone hammered at the front door.,The front door was hammered by someone.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Someone hammered at the front door.""
   - This means that an unspecified person performed the action of hammering at the front door.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The front door was hammered by someone.""
   - This is a passive construction of the same action described in the Premise. It indicates that the front door received the action of being hammered by an unspecified person.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: an unspecified person hammering at the front door.
   - The only difference is the grammatical structure: the Premise uses an active voice, while the Hypothesis uses a passive voice.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is simply a rephrasing of the Premise and conveys the same information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

0 – Entailment

The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.",The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.,False,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,"We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.",Charles Powell is a spokesman who is speaking on the behalf of others.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information provided step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.""
   - This sentence indicates that Charles Powell is making a statement about not wanting anyone to slip through the cracks.
   - The role of Charles Powell is explicitly mentioned as a ""spokesman.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Charles Powell is a spokesman who is speaking on the behalf of others.""
   - This sentence asserts that Charles Powell is a spokesman and implies that he is speaking on behalf of others.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise confirms that Charles Powell is a spokesman.
   - The Hypothesis adds the detail that he is speaking on behalf of others, which is a reasonable assumption given the role of a spokesman.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise and can be reasonably inferred from it.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,"We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.","We want people to slip through the cracks,  spokesman Charles Powell said.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.""
   - This means that Charles Powell is expressing a desire to prevent people from slipping through the cracks.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""We want people to slip through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.""
   - This means that Charles Powell is expressing a desire for people to slip through the cracks.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a desire to prevent people from slipping through the cracks.
   - The Hypothesis indicates a desire for people to slip through the cracks.
   - These two statements are directly opposite in meaning.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise and the Hypothesis express directly opposite desires, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

The correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.","Spokesman Charles Powell had said, ""We don't want anyone to slip through the cracks.""",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""We don't want anyone to SLIP through the cracks, spokesman Charles Powell said.""
   - This indicates that Charles Powell, who is a spokesman, made a statement about not wanting anyone to slip through the cracks.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Spokesman Charles Powell had said, 'We don't want anyone to slip through the cracks.'""
   - This is a direct quotation attributed to Charles Powell, indicating that he made the same statement as in the Premise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same information: Charles Powell, a spokesman, made a statement about not wanting anyone to slip through the cracks.
   - The wording in the Hypothesis is a direct quotation of the statement made by Charles Powell in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a direct restatement of the information provided in the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

0 – Entailment

The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:

intransitive-motion,schematic,The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.,There is a river called the Weantic River.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.""
   - This indicates that there is a river named ""Weweantic River"" and it flows through a pond.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""There is a river called the Weantic River.""
   - This statement asserts the existence of a river named ""Weantic River.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise mentions ""Weweantic River,"" while the Hypothesis mentions ""Weantic River.""
   - The names ""Weweantic River"" and ""Weantic River"" are not identical. The Hypothesis omits the ""we"" in the middle of the name.

4. **Inference**:
   - Since the names are different, we cannot definitively conclude that the ""Weweantic River"" mentioned in the Premise is the same as the ""Weantic River"" mentioned in the Hypothesis.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the existence of a river specifically named ""Weantic River.""

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.,The Weweantic River does not flow through the pond.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.""
   - This means that the Weweantic River is moving or passing through the pond.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The Weweantic River does not flow through the pond.""
   - This means that the Weweantic River is not moving or passing through the pond.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise asserts that the Weweantic River flows through the pond.
   - The Hypothesis asserts the opposite, that the Weweantic River does not flow through the pond.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise, it cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

The numerical value corresponding to Contradiction is **2**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.,Water from the Weweantic River moves through the pond.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The Weweantic River FLOWS through the pond.""
   - Key information: The Weweantic River is flowing through a pond.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Water from the Weweantic River moves through the pond.""
   - Key information: Water originating from the Weweantic River is moving through the pond.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the river itself flows through the pond.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that water from the river moves through the pond.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the river flows through the pond, it is reasonable to infer that water from the river is also moving through the pond. The flow of a river inherently involves the movement of its water.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or goes beyond what is stated in the Premise.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the Hypothesis is a direct implication of the Premise, the Hypothesis must be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment

Final answer:

intransitive-motion,schematic,In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.,In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital to appeal for an end to prescription drug abuse.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that several hundred people marched through the capital Phnom Penh in Cambodia.
   - The purpose of the march was to appeal for an end to growing drug use.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that several hundred people marched through the capital in Cambodia.
   - The purpose of the march was to appeal for an end to prescription drug abuse.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis agree on the location (the capital of Cambodia) and the action (marching).
   - The key difference lies in the specific type of drug use being addressed:
     - The premise mentions ""growing drug use"" in general.
     - The hypothesis specifies ""prescription drug abuse.""

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The premise does not specify the type of drug use, only that it is growing.
   - The hypothesis narrows it down to ""prescription drug abuse,"" which is a specific type of drug use.
   - Since the premise does not exclude prescription drug abuse (it could be part of the growing drug use mentioned), the hypothesis could be true but is not definitively confirmed by the premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.,In Cambodia few people walked through the capital Phnom Penh to deny an end to growing drug use.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each component step by step:

1. **Subject and Action:**
   - **Premise:** ""several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh""
   - **Hypothesis:** ""few people walked through the capital Phnom Penh""

   The Premise states that several hundred people marched, while the Hypothesis states that few people walked. The number of people and the action (marched vs. walked) are different. ""Several hundred"" is significantly more than ""few,"" and ""marched"" implies a more organized and purposeful movement compared to ""walked.""

2. **Purpose:**
   - **Premise:** ""to appeal for an end to growing drug use""
   - **Hypothesis:** ""to deny an end to growing drug use""

   The Premise indicates that the people were appealing for an end to growing drug use, which means they were advocating for stopping the increase in drug use. The Hypothesis, however, states that the people were denying an end to growing drug use, which implies they were against stopping the increase in drug use. This is a direct contradiction in purpose.

3. **Overall Comparison:**
   - The Premise and Hypothesis differ in the number of people involved and the nature of their action (marched vs. walked).
   - More importantly, the Premise and Hypothesis have opposite purposes regarding drug use (appealing for an end vs. denying an end).

Given these points, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because the purposes are directly contradictory.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,In Cambodia several hundred people MARCHED through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.,Several hundred people marched to appeal the end of growing drug use in Cambodia through the capital Phnom Penh.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information provided in both statements and compare them step by step.

### Premise:
- Location: Cambodia
- Event: Several hundred people marched
- Specific location within the country: Through the capital Phnom Penh
- Purpose: To appeal for an end to growing drug use

### Hypothesis:
- Event: Several hundred people marched
- Purpose: To appeal the end of growing drug use
- Location: Cambodia
- Specific location within the country: Through the capital Phnom Penh

### Comparison:
1. **Event Consistency**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis state that several hundred people marched.
   - This part is consistent.

2. **Purpose Consistency**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis state that the purpose of the march was to appeal for an end to growing drug use.
   - This part is consistent.

3. **Location Consistency**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention Cambodia and specifically the capital Phnom Penh.
   - This part is consistent.

### Conclusion:
- The Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details.
- The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,In VERY vivid detail I remember FALLING down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door.,"The speaker had great memory of events, but not great balance since they fell down the stairs like that.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker vividly remembers falling down the first flight of stairs in their house onto the landing in front of the main door.
   - Key points: vivid memory, falling down stairs, specific location (first flight of stairs, landing in front of the main door).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The speaker had great memory of events.
   - The speaker did not have great balance since they fell down the stairs.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The first part of the Hypothesis (""The speaker had great memory of events"") is supported by the Premise, which mentions the speaker's vivid memory of the event.
   - The second part of the Hypothesis (""not great balance since they fell down the stairs"") is an interpretation based on the event described in the Premise. Falling down the stairs could suggest a lack of balance, but it is not explicitly stated in the Premise. The fall could have been due to other reasons (e.g., tripping, an obstacle, etc.).

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The first part of the Hypothesis is entailed by the Premise.
   - The second part of the Hypothesis is an assumption that may or may not be true based on the information given in the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude the reason for the fall.

Given that the Hypothesis includes an assumption that is not definitively supported or contradicted by the Premise, the overall relationship is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,In VERY vivid detail I remember FALLING down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door.,I don't remember at all falling down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker vividly remembers falling down the first flight of stairs in their house onto the landing in front of the main door.
   - Key points: vivid detail, remembers, falling down the first flight of stairs, landing in front of the main door.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The speaker does not remember at all falling down the first flight of stairs in their house onto the landing in front of the main door.
   - Key points: does not remember at all, falling down the first flight of stairs, landing in front of the main door.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the speaker vividly remembers the event.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker does not remember the event at all.
   - These two statements are directly contradictory because one cannot both vividly remember and not remember at all the same event.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise and the Hypothesis cannot both be true at the same time, the relationship between them is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value for the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,In VERY vivid detail I remember FALLING down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door.,I fell down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door and I remember it all in very vivid detail.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker remembers falling down the first flight of stairs in their house.
   - The fall ended on the landing in front of the main door.
   - The memory of the event is described as being in very vivid detail.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The speaker fell down the first flight of stairs in their house.
   - The fall ended on the landing in front of the main door.
   - The speaker remembers the event in very vivid detail.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: falling down the first flight of stairs in the house onto the landing in front of the main door.
   - Both statements mention that the memory of the event is in very vivid detail.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details.
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise, the relationship between the two statements is one of entailment.

Therefore, the correct numerical value for the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,"People who SPILLED over from the ""protest"" attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.",An innocent person was driving down Regent Street when their car was attacked by protestors.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that people who ""spilled over"" from a protest attacked a car as it went down Regent Street.
   - Key points: 
     - There was a protest.
     - People from the protest attacked a car.
     - The location of the attack was Regent Street.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that an innocent person was driving down Regent Street when their car was attacked by protestors.
   - Key points:
     - An innocent person was driving.
     - The car was attacked by protestors.
     - The location of the attack was Regent Street.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis mention an attack on a car by protestors on Regent Street.
   - The premise does not specify who was driving the car, only that it was attacked by people from the protest.
   - The hypothesis adds the detail that the driver was an ""innocent person.""

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The premise does not provide information about the identity or innocence of the driver.
   - The hypothesis introduces new information (the innocence of the driver) that is not addressed in the premise.
   - Since the premise does not confirm or deny the innocence of the driver, the hypothesis may or may not be true based on the given information.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the final answer is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,"People who SPILLED over from the ""protest"" attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.","People who spilled over from the ""protest"" quietly watched their car as it went down Regent Street. (AMR)",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the content of both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that people who spilled over from the ""protest"" attacked a car as it went down Regent Street.
   - Key elements: ""spilled over from the 'protest'"", ""attacked their car"", ""went down Regent Street"".

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that people who spilled over from the ""protest"" quietly watched a car as it went down Regent Street.
   - Key elements: ""spilled over from the 'protest'"", ""quietly watched their car"", ""went down Regent Street"".

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention people who spilled over from the protest and a car going down Regent Street.
   - The critical difference lies in the actions of the people:
     - Premise: ""attacked their car""
     - Hypothesis: ""quietly watched their car""

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The action ""attacked"" in the Premise is directly contradictory to the action ""quietly watched"" in the Hypothesis.
   - If people are attacking a car, they cannot be quietly watching it at the same time. These actions are mutually exclusive.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"People who SPILLED over from the ""protest"" attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.","Their car was attacked by people who spilled over from the ""protest"" as it went down Regent Street.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""People who SPILLED over from the 'protest' attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.""
   - This statement indicates that a group of people, who were part of a protest, attacked a car while it was moving along Regent Street.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Their car was attacked by people who spilled over from the 'protest' as it went down Regent Street.""
   - This statement conveys that the car was attacked by the same group of people from the protest while it was traveling down Regent Street.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: a car being attacked by people from a protest on Regent Street.
   - The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is identical. Both statements specify the attackers (people from the protest) and the location and context of the attack (Regent Street, while the car was moving).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis restates the event described in the Premise without adding or contradicting any information, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.",Marchers will proceed on Market until they reach the capital building.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information provided in both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that marchers will proceed on Pine St. to Broadway, and then to Market.
   - This indicates a specific route: starting on Pine St., moving to Broadway, and then to Market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that marchers will proceed on Market until they reach the capital building.
   - This suggests that the marchers will continue on Market St. with the destination being the capital building.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not mention the final destination of the marchers; it only specifies the streets they will proceed on.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new piece of information: the final destination (the capital building) and the continuation on Market St.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise because the Premise does not provide information about the final destination or the continuation on Market St.
   - The Hypothesis is not necessarily entailed by the Premise because the Premise does not confirm that the marchers will continue on Market St. until they reach the capital building.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,"Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.",Marchers will stop at Pine St and not continue to Broadway nor Market.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.""
   - This indicates a sequence of movement: the marchers will start on Pine St., then move to Broadway, and finally proceed to Market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Marchers will stop at Pine St and not continue to Broadway nor Market.""
   - This suggests that the marchers will halt their movement at Pine St. and will not proceed to the subsequent locations mentioned in the Premise (Broadway and Market).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a continuous movement through multiple locations.
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that the marchers will stop at the first location (Pine St.) and will not continue to the other locations (Broadway and Market).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis states that the marchers will stop at Pine St. and not proceed further, it directly contradicts the Premise, which states that the marchers will proceed through multiple locations.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - The Premise states: ""Marchers will PROCEED on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market.""
   - This indicates a sequence of movement: starting from Pine St., then moving to Broadway, and finally to Market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - The Hypothesis states: ""From Pine St., to Broadway, then to Market marchers will continue.""
   - This also indicates a sequence of movement: starting from Pine St., then moving to Broadway, and finally to Market.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same sequence of locations: Pine St. → Broadway → Market.
   - The wording is slightly different, but the meaning conveyed is identical.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (both describe the same sequence of events), the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

intransitive-motion,schematic,"Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to MARCH around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.","Mine workers and supporters are protesting for fair wages at the Peabody Energy in St. Louis on this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information provided in both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - **Event**: Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to march.
   - **Location**: Around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis.
   - **Date**: This coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - **Event**: Mine workers and supporters are protesting for fair wages.
   - **Location**: At the Peabody Energy in St. Louis.
   - **Date**: This coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Event**: The Premise mentions a ""march,"" while the Hypothesis specifies ""protesting for fair wages."" A march can be a form of protest, but the Premise does not explicitly state the reason for the march.
   - **Location**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree on the location (Peabody Energy in St. Louis).
   - **Date**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree on the date (this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th).

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not provide information about the reason for the march. It only states that a march will occur.
   - The Hypothesis adds additional information by specifying that the march is a protest for fair wages.
   - Since the Premise does not confirm or deny the reason for the march, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information given in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

intransitive-motion,schematic,"Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to MARCH around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.","No mine workers or supporters plan to march around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to MARCH around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.""
   - This indicates a planned event involving a large number of people (thousands) who are mine workers and supporters.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that ""No mine workers or supporters plan to march around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.""
   - This suggests that there are no plans for any mine workers or supporters to march around the headquarters on the specified date.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a planned march involving thousands of mine workers and supporters.
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that no such plans exist.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis states the exact opposite of what the Premise asserts, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

The numerical value corresponding to Contradiction is **2**.

**Final Answer**:
2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to MARCH around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.","This coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th at Peabody Energy in St. Louis thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to march around the headquarters.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the content step by step:

1. **Identify Key Information in the Premise:**
   - **Event:** Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to march.
   - **Location:** Around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis.
   - **Date:** This coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.

2. **Identify Key Information in the Hypothesis:**
   - **Event:** Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to march.
   - **Location:** Around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis.
   - **Date:** This coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th.

3. **Compare the Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event (a march).
   - Both mention the same participants (thousands of mine workers and supporters).
   - Both specify the same location (around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis).
   - Both specify the same date (this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th).

4. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details.
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment

Therefore, the relation is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,"He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet , when a coil of gold , the color of the moonlight , FLASHED across the sand .","The man had vistied a totally different planet covered in sand that had looked like the wrong one, when a light flashed across the sand.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise describes a situation where a person is beginning to fear that he has come to the wrong planet.
   - It mentions a specific event: a coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashing across the sand.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that the man had visited a totally different planet covered in sand that looked like the wrong one.
   - It also mentions a light flashing across the sand.

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Similarity**: Both the premise and the hypothesis mention a light (or coil of gold) flashing across the sand.
   - **Difference**: The hypothesis introduces the idea that the man had visited a ""totally different planet"" covered in sand, which is not explicitly stated in the premise. The premise only suggests that the man feared he might be on the wrong planet, not that he had visited multiple planets.

4. **Inference**:
   - The hypothesis adds additional information that is not present in the premise (the idea of visiting multiple planets).
   - The premise does not confirm or deny the hypothesis's claim about visiting multiple planets; it only suggests a fear of being on the wrong planet.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the premise. The premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the hypothesis.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,"He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet , when a coil of gold , the color of the moonlight , FLASHED across the sand .","He was not afraid that he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, FLASHED across the sand.""
   - This sentence indicates that the subject was starting to feel fear about being on the wrong planet. The fear is linked to the moment when a coil of gold flashed across the sand.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He was not afraid that he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand.""
   - This sentence states the opposite: the subject was not afraid of being on the wrong planet at the same moment when a coil of gold flashed across the sand.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the subject was beginning to be afraid.
   - The Hypothesis states that the subject was not afraid.
   - These two statements are directly contradictory because one indicates the presence of fear, while the other indicates the absence of fear.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise, the relationship between them is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet"" indicates a state of fear or doubt about being on the correct planet.
   - ""when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, FLASHED across the sand"" describes an event that happened while he was experiencing this fear.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""A coil of gold, the color of moonlight, flashed across the sand"" describes the same event as in the premise.
   - ""as he was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet"" indicates the same state of fear or doubt about being on the correct planet.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event (a coil of gold flashing across the sand) and the same state of mind (beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet).
   - The order of the clauses is slightly different, but the meaning remains the same.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - The Hypothesis restates the event and the state of mind described in the Premise without adding or contradicting any information.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,I RAN around the track.,I run professionally.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I RAN around the track.""
   - This indicates that the speaker engaged in running around a track at some point in the past.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I run professionally.""
   - This suggests that the speaker engages in running as a profession, implying regular and possibly competitive running activities.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a single instance of running around a track, which does not provide information about the frequency, context, or professional nature of the running.
   - The Hypothesis makes a broader claim about the speaker's running being a professional activity, which involves regular and possibly competitive running.

4. **Inference**:
   - From the Premise alone, we cannot definitively conclude that the speaker runs professionally. The Premise only mentions a single instance of running, which could be recreational, casual, or for any other non-professional reason.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. There is no direct contradiction, but there is also no definitive support for the professional aspect of running.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,I RAN around the track.,I walked around the track.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I RAN around the track.""
   - This indicates that the subject performed the action of running around the track.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I walked around the track.""
   - This indicates that the subject performed the action of walking around the track.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Running and walking are two distinct actions. Running generally implies a faster pace and more exertion compared to walking.
   - If someone ran around the track, it does not imply that they walked around the track. In fact, running and walking are mutually exclusive in this context because one cannot be running and walking at the same time.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - Given that the Premise states the subject ran, it directly contradicts the Hypothesis that the subject walked.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

The final numerical value is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,I RAN around the track.,I circled the track by running.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I RAN around the track.""
   - This means the speaker engaged in the activity of running and completed a circuit around the track.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I circled the track by running.""
   - This means the speaker completed a circuit around the track specifically by running.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same activity: running around the track.
   - The Premise explicitly mentions running around the track.
   - The Hypothesis also explicitly mentions running and completing a circuit around the track.

4. **Inference**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because both statements describe the same action in slightly different words.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or adds uncertainty to the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DROVE through the tunnel.,I was driving in my car,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I DROVE through the tunnel.""
   - This indicates that the speaker was driving and that the action took place through a tunnel.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I was driving in my car.""
   - This suggests that the speaker was driving a car.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise confirms that the speaker was driving, but it does not explicitly mention the vehicle.
   - The Hypothesis specifies that the speaker was driving a car.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm that the speaker was driving a car. The speaker could have been driving another type of vehicle (e.g., a motorcycle, a truck, etc.).
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. There is no direct contradiction, but there is also no definitive confirmation.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DROVE through the tunnel.,I avoided the tunnel.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I DROVE through the tunnel.""
   - This means that the speaker took a route that involved passing through the tunnel.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I avoided the tunnel.""
   - This means that the speaker took a route that did not involve passing through the tunnel.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the speaker did go through the tunnel.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that the speaker did not go through the tunnel.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If the speaker drove through the tunnel, it is impossible for them to have avoided the tunnel at the same time.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,I DROVE through the tunnel.,I went throught the tunnel by driving.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I DROVE through the tunnel.""
   - This means that the speaker used a vehicle to pass through a tunnel.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I went through the tunnel by driving.""
   - This means that the speaker passed through a tunnel and the method of passage was by driving.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action: passing through a tunnel.
   - Both statements specify the method of passage as driving.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise with the same meaning.
   - There is no additional information or contradiction introduced in the Hypothesis.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,We DROVE past the hotel.,We DROVE all the way to the next city.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""We DROVE past the hotel.""
   - This indicates that the action of driving occurred and that the driving continued past a specific point, which is the hotel.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""We DROVE all the way to the next city.""
   - This suggests that the driving continued until reaching a destination, which is the next city.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not specify the final destination of the driving; it only mentions that the driving continued past the hotel.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a new piece of information by specifying that the driving continued all the way to the next city.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the driving continued to the next city. However, the Premise does not specify the final destination, so we cannot be certain that the driving continued to the next city based solely on the Premise.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny that the driving continued to the next city. It is possible that the driving could have stopped before reaching the next city or continued beyond it.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly conflicts with the Hypothesis. There is no such conflicting information in the Premise; it does not state that the driving stopped before reaching the next city or that the next city was not reached.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate inference relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,We DROVE past the hotel.,We drove straight to the hotel.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""We DROVE past the hotel.""
   - This means that the action of driving occurred and the hotel was a point that was passed by during the drive.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""We drove straight to the hotel.""
   - This implies that the destination of the drive was the hotel and that the driving was direct to that location.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the hotel was passed by, suggesting that the hotel was not the final destination or that the driving did not stop at the hotel.
   - The Hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the hotel was the final destination and that the driving was direct to it.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If the Premise states that the hotel was passed by, it directly contradicts the Hypothesis which states that the hotel was the destination.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2

   - The key information here is that the action of driving past the hotel has occurred.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""We were driving when we went past the hotel.""
   - The key information here is that the action of driving was happening at the time of passing the hotel.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the action of driving past the hotel took place.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that driving was the mode of transportation when passing the hotel.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially rephrasing the Premise with a focus on the continuous aspect of the action (driving) at the time of passing the hotel.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new elements that would make it uncertain or neutral.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.,The plane flew to its destination of California.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

   - The Premise states: ""The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.""
   - This indicates that the plane was in flight and its path included flying over the Grand Canyon.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The plane flew to its destination of California.""
   - This suggests that the plane's final destination was California.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise provides information about the plane's flight path (over the Grand Canyon) but does not specify the final destination.
   - The Hypothesis specifies a final destination (California) but does not provide information about the flight path.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the final destination of the plane.
   - It is possible that a plane flying over the Grand Canyon could be heading to California, but it is also possible that it could be heading somewhere else.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.""
   - This means that the plane traveled through the air above the Grand Canyon.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The plane didn't pass over the Grand Canyon.""
   - This means that the plane did not travel through the air above the Grand Canyon.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise asserts that the plane did fly over the Grand Canyon.
   - The Hypothesis asserts that the plane did not fly over the Grand Canyon.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If the Premise is true (the plane flew over the Grand Canyon), then the Hypothesis (the plane didn't pass over the Grand Canyon) must be false.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.,The plane was flying when it went over the Grand Canyon.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The plane FLEW over the Grand Canyon.""
   - This indicates that at some point in time, a plane was in the air and traveled over the Grand Canyon.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The plane was flying when it went over the Grand Canyon.""
   - This suggests that during the time the plane was over the Grand Canyon, it was in the act of flying.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise explicitly states that the plane ""FLEW"" over the Grand Canyon, which implies that the plane was indeed flying at that time.
   - The Hypothesis asserts that the plane ""was flying"" when it went over the Grand Canyon, which is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment

The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

intransitive-motion,schematic,I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .,I pass by Watkins Landing on my way into work and back home.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker drives past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
   - This implies a regular, daily occurrence of passing by Watkins Landing.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The speaker passes by Watkins Landing on their way into work and back home.
   - This also implies a regular, daily occurrence of passing by Watkins Landing, specifically tied to commuting to and from work.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a regular, daily occurrence of passing by Watkins Landing.
   - The Premise does not explicitly mention the purpose of the drive (e.g., going to work or returning home), but it does specify the times (morning and evening).
   - The Hypothesis specifies the purpose of the drive (commuting to work and back home), which typically aligns with morning and evening times.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis adds specific details about the purpose of the drive (commuting to work and back home) that are not explicitly stated in the Premise.
   - However, the times mentioned in the Premise (morning and evening) are consistent with typical commuting times.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is a plausible and reasonable interpretation of the Premise, but it is not definitively entailed because the Premise does not explicitly state the purpose of the drive.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Thus, the final answer is:

1",1,False,True,False,1

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I DRIVE past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This means that the speaker regularly drives past Watkins Landing twice a day.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I avoid going past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This means that the speaker makes an effort not to go past Watkins Landing at those times.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates a regular action of driving past Watkins Landing.
   - The Hypothesis indicates a regular action of avoiding going past Watkins Landing.

4. **Inference**:
   - If the speaker drives past Watkins Landing every morning and evening, it directly contradicts the idea that they avoid going past it at those times.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

The final numerical value is:
2",2,False,False,True,2

   - This means that the speaker drives past a specific location, Watkins Landing, twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""My driving route goes past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.""
   - This implies that the speaker's driving route includes passing by Watkins Landing twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action: driving past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
   - The Premise explicitly states the action of driving past Watkins Landing at specific times of the day.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases this action by specifying that the driving route includes passing by Watkins Landing at the same times.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions.
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis must be true because it directly follows from the information provided in the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

   - The Premise does not specify the mode of transportation, while the Hypothesis specifies commuting by bike.
   - The Premise does not mention the reasons for commuting, while the Hypothesis provides reasons (staying healthy and enjoying the views).

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional details (mode of transportation and reasons for commuting) that are not mentioned in the Premise.
   - These additional details (commuting by bike, staying healthy, enjoying views) are not contradicted by the Premise, but they are also not confirmed by it.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Final answer:

   - This means the speaker travels to and from work using the Huguenot Trail.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""I take the Hugenot Trail back and forth to work.""
   - This means the speaker uses the Huguenot Trail for their commute to and from work.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same action: commuting to and from work using the Huguenot Trail.
   - The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is identical.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they both describe the same commuting action on the Huguenot Trail), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Dade County and federal authorities learned that ""he"" intended to fly through Miami.
   - They made plans to arrest him on gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Dade County and federal authorities are described as ""famous for daring arrests.""
   - They made plans to arrest him on gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis state that Dade County and federal authorities made plans to arrest him on gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil. This part is consistent between both statements.
   - The additional information in the Hypothesis is that Dade County and federal authorities are ""famous for daring arrests."" This detail is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The additional information in the Hypothesis about the authorities being ""famous for daring arrests"" does not contradict the Premise. It is an extra detail that is not addressed in the Premise.
   - Since the Hypothesis introduces new information that is not necessarily implied by the Premise but does not contradict it, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is **Neutral**.

Final answer:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that Dade County and federal authorities learned that a person intended to fly through Miami.
   - As a result of this knowledge, they made plans to arrest him on gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that Dade County and federal authorities did not know that the person intended to fly through Miami.
   - Consequently, they did not make plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that the authorities were aware of the person's travel plans and made arrest plans accordingly.
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that the authorities were not aware of the travel plans and therefore did not make any arrest plans.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis is in direct contradiction to the information provided in the Premise.
   - If the Premise is true, the Hypothesis cannot be true because it states the opposite situation regarding the authorities' knowledge and actions.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

- **Timing**: As soon as he touched U.S. soil.

### Comparison:
1. **Entities Involved**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention ""Dade County and federal authorities.""
   - This is consistent between both statements.

2. **Action**:
   - Both statements indicate that the authorities made plans to arrest him on gun-running charges.
   - This is also consistent.

3. **Condition**:
   - The Premise states ""learning that he intended to FLY through Miami.""
   - The Hypothesis states ""once they learned he intended to fly into Miami.""
   - The wording is slightly different (""through"" vs. ""into""), but the meaning is essentially the same: the authorities learned about his intention to fly via Miami.

4. **Timing**:
   - The Premise states ""as soon as he hit U.S. soil.""
   - The Hypothesis states ""as soon as he touched U.S. soil.""
   - Both phrases indicate the same timing for the arrest plans.

### Conclusion:
- The Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise with slightly different wording but does not introduce any new information or contradictions.
- The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Oguz mentions that anyone flying over major opium-producing areas would see a lot of small fires in the mountains.
   - These small fires are identified as heroin labs.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that major opium-producing areas that house heroin labs can be spotted by looking for small fires from high above.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise provides specific information that flying over these areas would reveal small fires, which are heroin labs.
   - The hypothesis generalizes this information by stating that these areas can be spotted by looking for small fires from high above.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The hypothesis is essentially a restatement of the premise in a more general form.
   - The premise directly supports the hypothesis by providing the same information: small fires seen from above indicate heroin labs in major opium-producing areas.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

   - Oguz said that anyone flying over the major opium producing areas would see a lot of small fires in the mountains.
   - These small fires are identified as heroin labs.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Oguz said that anyone flying over the major opium producing areas would not be able to see any small fires in the mountains.
   - These small fires are identified as heroin labs.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that small fires (heroin labs) are visible from the air.
   - The Hypothesis states that small fires (heroin labs) are not visible from the air.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise asserts visibility of the fires, while the Hypothesis asserts the opposite, that the fires are not visible.

Given this direct contradiction, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,"Oguz said that anyone FLYING over the major opium producing areas would see a lot of small fires in the mountains, which are heroin labs.","Anyone would be able to see a lot of small fires in the mountains, which are heroin labs, if you are flying over major opium producing areas said Oguz.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Oguz made a statement.
   - The statement is about what one would see when flying over major opium-producing areas.
   - Specifically, one would see a lot of small fires in the mountains.
   - These small fires are identified as heroin labs.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis rephrases Oguz's statement.
   - It states that anyone flying over major opium-producing areas would see a lot of small fires in the mountains.
   - These small fires are identified as heroin labs.
   - The hypothesis attributes this statement to Oguz.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same information.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis maintains the same conditions and outcomes as stated in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that each year, over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter in Hong Kong.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that each year, over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers and have inspired beautiful art for generations.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis agree on the fact that over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers each year.
   - The premise adds that these birds choose to roost for winter in Hong Kong.
   - The hypothesis adds that these birds have inspired beautiful art for generations.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The additional information in the hypothesis (that the birds have inspired beautiful art for generations) is not mentioned in the premise.
   - The premise does not provide any information about whether the birds have inspired art or not.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis introduces new information that is not directly supported or contradicted by the premise.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the premise. This means the relationship is neutral.

Final Decision:
1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Each year , over 50,000 migratory birds FLY over Hong Kong 's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here .","Each year , over 50,000 migratory birds go around Hong Kong 's skyscrapers and choose to not roost for winter here .",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that each year, over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter in Hong Kong.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that each year, over 50,000 migratory birds go around Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose not to roost for winter in Hong Kong.

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Flying over vs. Going around**: The premise mentions that the birds fly over the skyscrapers, while the hypothesis states that the birds go around the skyscrapers. This is a difference in the path taken by the birds.
   - **Roosting vs. Not Roosting**: The premise states that the birds choose to roost for winter in Hong Kong, while the hypothesis states that the birds choose not to roost for winter in Hong Kong. This is a direct contradiction regarding the birds' behavior.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The key point of contradiction is the roosting behavior. The premise clearly states that the birds roost in Hong Kong, while the hypothesis states that they do not roost in Hong Kong. These two statements cannot both be true simultaneously.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:
2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"Each year , over 50,000 migratory birds FLY over Hong Kong 's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here .","Over 50,000 migratory birds choose to roost for winter each year as they fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information provided in both statements and compare them step by step.

### Premise:
- Each year, over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers.
- These birds choose to roost for winter in Hong Kong.

### Hypothesis:
- Over 50,000 migratory birds choose to roost for winter each year.
- These birds fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Quantitative Information**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention ""over 50,000 migratory birds"" and ""each year."" This part is consistent between the two statements.

2. **Action and Sequence**:
   - The Premise states that the birds ""fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers"" and then ""choose to roost for winter here.""
   - The Hypothesis states that the birds ""choose to roost for winter each year"" and they ""fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers.""

3. **Order of Events**:
   - The order of events in the Premise is: flying over skyscrapers → choosing to roost.
   - The order of events in the Hypothesis is: choosing to roost → flying over skyscrapers.

4. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The order of events does not change the overall meaning significantly. Both statements imply that the birds fly over the skyscrapers and then roost in Hong Kong for the winter. The slight reordering in the Hypothesis does not introduce any contradiction or uncertainty.

### Conclusion:
- The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. The slight reordering of events does not affect the truth of the Hypothesis based on the information provided in the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,But it's all FLYING right over your head.,They are not understanding the point.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The phrase ""But it's all FLYING right over your head"" is an idiomatic expression.
   - This idiom typically means that someone is not understanding or grasping the point being made.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states, ""They are not understanding the point.""
   - This is a straightforward statement indicating a lack of understanding.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The idiom in the Premise (""FLYING right over your head"") directly implies the same situation described in the Hypothesis (""not understanding the point"").
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same meaning: a lack of understanding.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a direct restatement of the meaning conveyed by the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,But it's all FLYING right over your head.,But it's all sticking in your head.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The phrase ""But it's all FLYING right over your head"" is an idiomatic expression.
   - It means that the information or content is not being understood or grasped by the person.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The phrase ""But it's all sticking in your head"" is also an idiomatic expression.
   - It means that the information or content is being understood and remembered by the person.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise suggests a lack of understanding or retention of information.
   - The Hypothesis suggests the opposite: that the information is being understood and retained.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Premise indicates that the information is not being understood (flying over the head) and the Hypothesis indicates that the information is being understood (sticking in the head), these two statements are directly contradictory.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

intransitive-motion,schematic,But it's all FLYING right over your head.,But it's all going right over your head.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""But it's all FLYING right over your head.""
   - The key elements here are ""FLYING"" and ""right over your head.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""But it's all going right over your head.""
   - The key elements here are ""going"" and ""right over your head.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both statements share the phrase ""right over your head,"" which indicates that something is not being understood or is being missed by the person being addressed.
   - The difference lies in the verbs: ""FLYING"" in the Premise and ""going"" in the Hypothesis.

4. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The verb ""FLYING"" implies a rapid or swift movement, while ""going"" is more general and can imply movement without specifying speed.
   - Despite this difference, the overall meaning conveyed by both statements is essentially the same: something is not being comprehended by the person.

5. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis is a more general way of expressing the same idea as the Premise.
   - Therefore, if the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must also be true.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

intransitive-motion,schematic,"It will be like you're FLOATING along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.",Quitting smoking may imrove your ability to swim and complete other cardiovascular exercises.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise describes a scenario where a person feels like they are floating along fine, but then suddenly experiences a strong urge to smoke.
   - This suggests a struggle with quitting smoking, highlighting the sudden and overwhelming nature of cravings.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that quitting smoking may improve one's ability to swim and complete other cardiovascular exercises.
   - This is a general statement about the potential health benefits of quitting smoking, particularly in relation to physical fitness and cardiovascular activities.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise focuses on the experience of cravings when trying to quit smoking.
   - The hypothesis discusses the potential health benefits of quitting smoking, specifically in terms of physical fitness.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The premise does not provide any information about the health benefits of quitting smoking or its impact on physical fitness.
   - The hypothesis is a general statement that could be true, but it is not directly supported or contradicted by the premise.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise, as the premise does not address the same topic as the hypothesis.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise describes a situation where a person feels like they are ""floating along fine"" and then suddenly experiences a ""huge swell of the urge to smoke.""
   - Key points: ""floating along fine"" suggests a state of ease or normalcy, and ""huge swell of the urge to smoke"" indicates a sudden, strong desire to smoke.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis describes a situation where a person feels like they are ""stopped, unable to move"" and then ""finally you are freed by the urge to smoke.""
   - Key points: ""stopped, unable to move"" suggests a state of being stuck or immobilized, and ""freed by the urge to smoke"" indicates that the urge to smoke releases them from this state.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise and hypothesis describe different initial states: ""floating along fine"" (ease) vs. ""stopped, unable to move"" (immobilized).
   - The premise describes the urge to smoke as a sudden, overwhelming force, while the hypothesis describes it as something that frees the person from being stuck.
   - These descriptions are not compatible; the premise suggests a disruption of ease, while the hypothesis suggests a release from immobilization.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis cannot be true given the premise because the initial states and the effects of the urge to smoke are fundamentally different and contradictory.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

2 – Contradiction",2 – Contradiction,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,"It will be like you're FLOATING along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.",In an instant you will be caught up in this huge urge to smoke after feeling like you're floating along fine.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise describes a situation where a person feels like they are ""floating along fine"" and then suddenly experiences a ""huge swell of the urge to smoke.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that ""in an instant you will be caught up in this huge urge to smoke after feeling like you're floating along fine.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis describe the same sequence of events: feeling fine (floating along) followed by a sudden, strong urge to smoke.
   - The wording is slightly different, but the meaning conveyed is essentially the same.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the hypothesis restates the sequence of events described in the premise without adding or contradicting any information, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.,Laws change all the time throughout the years.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.""
   - This suggests that there is an expectation or prediction that the law will change frequently or unpredictably in the future.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Laws change all the time throughout the years.""
   - This suggests a general statement that laws are subject to frequent changes over time.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise talks about a specific prediction for the future, indicating that the law will likely change frequently in the coming years.
   - The Hypothesis makes a broader, more general statement about the nature of laws changing frequently over time.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not definitively confirm or deny the general statement made in the Hypothesis. It only talks about a specific future scenario.
   - The Hypothesis could be true if the Premise is true, but the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm the generality of the Hypothesis.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Final answer:
1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.,The law will probably stay the same in the coming years.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.""
   - This suggests that the law is expected to change frequently and unpredictably over the coming years.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""The law will probably stay the same in the coming years.""
   - This suggests that the law is expected to remain stable and unchanged over the coming years.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates a high likelihood of frequent changes in the law.
   - The hypothesis indicates a high likelihood of no changes in the law.
   - These two statements are directly opposing each other. If the law is expected to change frequently, it cannot simultaneously be expected to stay the same.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, the hypothesis cannot be true if the premise is true.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.,In the coming years the law will most likely jump back and forth.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The law will probably JUMP back and forth in the coming years.""
   - Key points:
     - ""The law"" is the subject.
     - ""will probably"" indicates a high likelihood but not certainty.
     - ""JUMP back and forth"" describes the action.
     - ""in the coming years"" specifies the time frame.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""In the coming years the law will most likely jump back and forth.""
   - Key points:
     - ""In the coming years"" specifies the same time frame as the Premise.
     - ""the law"" is the same subject.
     - ""will most likely"" indicates a high likelihood, similar to ""will probably.""
     - ""jump back and forth"" describes the same action.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis discuss the same subject (""the law"") and the same action (""jump back and forth"").
   - Both statements indicate a high likelihood of the action occurring, with ""will probably"" and ""will most likely"" being nearly synonymous in this context.
   - The time frame ""in the coming years"" is identical in both statements.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given that the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same information with slightly different wording but equivalent meaning, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
intransitive-motion,schematic,The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.,The 23 are scared the sub is sinking.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.""
   - Key points:
     - There are 23 individuals.
     - They are described as ""frantically"" scrambling.
     - The action is directed towards the rear of the submarine.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The 23 are scared the sub is sinking.""
   - Key points:
     - The 23 individuals are described as being scared.
     - The reason for their fear is that they believe the submarine is sinking.

3. **Comparison and Inference**:
   - The Premise describes a frantic action, which implies a sense of urgency or panic.
   - The Hypothesis provides a possible reason for this frantic behavior: fear that the submarine is sinking.
   - The Premise does not explicitly state the reason for the frantic scrambling, only the action itself.
   - The Hypothesis introduces an additional element (fear of sinking) that is not directly mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Determining the Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the 23 individuals are scared because they think the sub is sinking. The Premise does not provide this specific information.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise. The frantic scrambling could be due to fear of sinking, but it could also be due to other reasons (e.g., a fire, an order from a superior, etc.). The Premise does not confirm or deny the specific reason for the scrambling.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise would need to provide information that directly contradicts the idea that the 23 individuals are scared because they think the sub is sinking. The Premise does not provide any such contradictory information.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.,The 23 were calm at the rear of the sub.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.""
   - Key points:
     - ""23"" refers to a group of people.
     - ""frantically SCRAMBLED"" indicates a sense of urgency, chaos, or panic.
     - ""to the rear of the sub"" specifies the location they were moving towards.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The 23 were calm at the rear of the sub.""
   - Key points:
     - ""23"" refers to the same group of people.
     - ""were calm"" indicates a state of tranquility or lack of panic.
     - ""at the rear of the sub"" specifies the same location as in the Premise.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes the 23 people as ""frantically SCRAMBLED,"" which implies they were in a state of panic or urgency.
   - The Hypothesis describes the same 23 people as ""calm,"" which is the opposite of being frantic or panicked.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - Since ""frantically SCRAMBLED"" and ""calm"" are contradictory states, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.
   - Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of contradiction.

Based on this analysis, the correct numerical value for the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.,The rear of the sub had 23 frantically scrambling towards it.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The 23 frantically SCRAMBLED to the rear of the sub.""
   - This sentence indicates that a group of 23 individuals or entities were moving in a hurried and disorganized manner towards the rear of the submarine.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The rear of the sub had 23 frantically scrambling towards it.""
   - This sentence suggests that the rear of the submarine was the destination for 23 individuals or entities who were moving in a hurried and disorganized manner.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: 23 individuals or entities moving frantically towards the rear of the submarine.
   - The direction of movement (towards the rear of the sub) and the number of individuals (23) are consistent in both statements.
   - The manner of movement (frantically scrambling) is also consistent.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis restates the event described in the Premise without adding or contradicting any information, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

intransitive-motion,schematic,IRNA reported that Gomshadzehi killed a policeman and then ESCAPED to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates while trafficking drugs in 2003.,There is a criminal named Gomshadzehi who did not care about the lives of others or himself when he carried out his crimes in 2003.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information provided in each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - The premise states that IRNA reported an individual named Gomshadzehi killed a policeman.
   - Gomshadzehi then escaped to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
   - This event occurred while Gomshadzehi was trafficking drugs in 2003.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - The hypothesis claims that there is a criminal named Gomshadzehi.
   - It further asserts that Gomshadzehi did not care about the lives of others or himself when he carried out his crimes in 2003.

3. **Comparison and Inference:**
   - The premise confirms the existence of a criminal named Gomshadzehi.
   - The premise also provides specific details about Gomshadzehi's criminal activities in 2003, including killing a policeman and trafficking drugs.
   - The hypothesis makes a general statement about Gomshadzehi's disregard for the lives of others or himself during his crimes in 2003.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - The premise does not explicitly state that Gomshadzehi did not care about the lives of others or himself. However, the actions described (killing a policeman and trafficking drugs) could imply a disregard for the lives of others.
   - The hypothesis is making an inference about Gomshadzehi's mindset based on his actions, which is not directly stated in the premise but could be reasonably inferred.

Given that the hypothesis is not definitively true or false based on the premise but could be reasonably inferred, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,IRNA reported that Gomshadzehi killed a policeman and then ESCAPED to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates while trafficking drugs in 2003.,IRNA reported that Gomshadzehi helped a policeman and was captive in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates while trafficking drugs in 2003.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's break down the information provided in each statement and compare them step by step.

### Premise Analysis:
1. **Source**: IRNA reported.
2. **Subject**: Gomshadzehi.
3. **Actions**:
   - Killed a policeman.
   - Escaped to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
   - Was trafficking drugs in 2003.

### Hypothesis Analysis:
1. **Source**: IRNA reported.
2. **Subject**: Gomshadzehi.
3. **Actions**:
   - Helped a policeman.
   - Was captive in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
   - Was trafficking drugs in 2003.

### Comparison:
1. **Source**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention IRNA as the source. This is consistent.
2. **Subject**: Both statements refer to Gomshadzehi. This is consistent.
3. **Actions**:
   - **Premise**: Gomshadzehi killed a policeman.
   - **Hypothesis**: Gomshadzehi helped a policeman.
     - These actions are directly contradictory. Killing a policeman and helping a policeman are mutually exclusive actions.
   - **Premise**: Gomshadzehi escaped to Dubai.
   - **Hypothesis**: Gomshadzehi was captive in Dubai.
     - These actions are also contradictory. Escaping to Dubai implies freedom, while being captive in Dubai implies being held against one's will.
   - **Both**: Trafficking drugs in 2003.
     - This part is consistent in both statements.

### Conclusion:
The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are directly contradictory in two significant aspects: the interaction with the policeman and the status in Dubai. Given these contradictions, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation is:

**2 – Contradiction**",**2 – Contradiction**,False,False,True,2

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - Source: IRNA reported.
   - Event: Gomshadzehi killed a policeman.
   - Subsequent Action: ESCAPED to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
   - Context: While trafficking drugs.
   - Time: In 2003.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - Source: It was reported by IRNA.
   - Event: Gomshadzehi escaped to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
   - Preceding Action: After killing a policeman.
   - Context: While trafficking drugs.
   - Time: In 2003.

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Source Consistency**: Both the Premise and Hypothesis mention IRNA as the reporting source.
   - **Event Sequence**: Both state that Gomshadzehi killed a policeman and then escaped to Dubai.
   - **Context Consistency**: Both mention the context of trafficking drugs.
   - **Temporal Consistency**: Both specify the year 2003.

4. **Paraphrasing Check**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a paraphrased version of the Premise. The sequence of events and the context remain unchanged.
   - The Hypothesis uses ""after killing a policeman"" instead of ""and then ESCAPED,"" but the meaning is preserved.

5. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis restates the information in the Premise without altering the meaning or introducing any new information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""Armed troops MARCHED to the substations and turned the power back on.""
   - Key points: Armed troops, marched to substations, turned power back on.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that ""Armed troops MARCHED to the substations that powered over half of the city.""
   - Key points: Armed troops, marched to substations, substations powered over half of the city.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that armed troops marched to the substations.
   - The Premise mentions that the troops turned the power back on, but it does not specify the extent of the power coverage of the substations.
   - The Hypothesis adds a specific detail that the substations powered over half of the city, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information (the substations powered over half of the city) that is not present in the Premise.
   - This new information is not contradicted by the Premise, but it is also not confirmed by it.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1
intransitive-motion,schematic,Armed troops MARCHED to the substations and turned the power back on.,Armed troops left the substations and turned the power off.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""Armed troops MARCHED to the substations and turned the power back on.""
   - Key points:
     - Armed troops marched to the substations.
     - They turned the power back on.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""Armed troops left the substations and turned the power off.""
   - Key points:
     - Armed troops left the substations.
     - They turned the power off.

3. **Comparison:**
   - **Movement Direction:**
     - Premise: Troops marched to the substations.
     - Hypothesis: Troops left the substations.
     - These actions are opposite in direction. The Premise indicates the troops are arriving, while the Hypothesis indicates they are departing.
   
   - **Action on Power:**
     - Premise: Troops turned the power back on.
     - Hypothesis: Troops turned the power off.
     - These actions are also opposite. The Premise indicates the power is being restored, while the Hypothesis indicates the power is being cut off.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict the actions described in the Premise. The troops cannot both be arriving and departing at the same time, nor can they be turning the power on and off simultaneously.

Given these points, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
intransitive-motion,schematic,Armed troops MARCHED to the substations and turned the power back on.,The power was turned back on by armed troops that marched to the substations.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the content step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Armed troops MARCHED to the substations and turned the power back on.""
   - Key elements:
     - Armed troops are the subject.
     - The action involves marching to the substations.
     - The result of their action is turning the power back on.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The power was turned back on by armed troops that marched to the substations.""
   - Key elements:
     - The power being turned back on is the main event.
     - The action is performed by armed troops.
     - The troops marched to the substations to perform this action.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: armed troops marching to substations and turning the power back on.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but maintains the same meaning and sequence of events.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any uncertainty or new possibilities that are not covered by the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the same information without adding or contradicting any details, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Premise:**
   - Source: The Vietnam News Agency.
   - Subject: Australian national Tran Van Thanh.
   - Event: Arrested on 30 June 2003.
   - Location: Southern Vietnam city of Dalat.
   - Reason: Involvement in a network smuggling heroin from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam.

2. **Hypothesis:**
   - Source: The Vietnam News Agency, which has earned several prizes for journalism.
   - Subject: Australian national Tran Van Thanh.
   - Event: Arrested on 30 June 2003.
   - Location: Southern Vietnam city of Dalat.
   - Reason: Involvement in a network smuggling heroin.

### Comparison:

- **Source:**
  - Premise: The Vietnam News Agency.
  - Hypothesis: The Vietnam News Agency, which has earned several prizes for journalism.
  - **Analysis:** The additional information about the Vietnam News Agency earning several prizes for journalism does not affect the core information about the arrest. This is supplementary information and does not change the factual content.

- **Subject:**
  - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention ""Australian national Tran Van Thanh.""

- **Event:**
  - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis state that Tran Van Thanh was arrested on 30 June 2003.

- **Location:**
  - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the arrest took place in the southern Vietnam city of Dalat.

- **Reason:**
  - Premise: Involvement in a network smuggling heroin from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam.
  - Hypothesis: Involvement in a network smuggling heroin.
  - **Analysis:** The Hypothesis omits the specific details about the smuggling route (from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam). However, it does not contradict the Premise; it simply provides less detail.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis is a less detailed version of the Premise but does not contradict it. The core information about the arrest, the subject, the date, and the location remains consistent. The additional detail about the Vietnam News Agency's prizes is supplementary and does not affect the truth of the Hypothesis given the Premise.

Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

### Premise:
- Source: The Vietnam News Agency
- Subject: Australian national Tran Van Thanh
- Event: Arrested on 30 June 2003
- Location: Southern Vietnam city of Dalat
- Reason: Involvement in a network smuggling heroin from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam

### Hypothesis:
- Source: The Vietnam News Agency
- Subject: Australian national Tran Van Thanh
- Event: Arrested on 30 June 2003
- Location: Southern Vietnam city of Dalat
- Reason: Involvement in a network hoarding and keeping heroin strictly in Cambodia

### Comparison:
1. **Source, Subject, Event, and Location**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree on the source (The Vietnam News Agency), the subject (Tran Van Thanh), the event (arrested on 30 June 2003), and the location (southern Vietnam city of Dalat).

2. **Reason for Arrest**:
   - **Premise**: Involvement in a network smuggling heroin from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam.
   - **Hypothesis**: Involvement in a network hoarding and keeping heroin strictly in Cambodia.

### Analysis:
- The Premise states that Tran Van Thanh was involved in smuggling heroin from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam, which implies movement of heroin across multiple countries.
- The Hypothesis states that Tran Van Thanh was involved in hoarding and keeping heroin strictly in Cambodia, which implies that the heroin did not leave Cambodia.

### Conclusion:
- The two statements provide conflicting information about the nature of Tran Van Thanh's involvement with heroin. The Premise indicates international smuggling, while the Hypothesis indicates hoarding within Cambodia only.
- Given this contradiction in the reason for the arrest, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

6. **Source**: Said the Vietnam News Agency.

### Comparison:
- **Person**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention Tran Van Thanh, an Australian national.
- **Event**: Both state that Tran Van Thanh was arrested.
- **Date**: Both specify the date as 30 June 2003.
- **Location**: Both mention the southern Vietnam city of Dalat.
- **Reason**: Both state the reason for the arrest as involvement in a network smuggling heroin from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam.
- **Source**: Both mention the Vietnam News Agency as the source of the information.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis restates the information provided in the Premise almost verbatim, with no additional information or contradictions. Every detail in the Hypothesis is directly supported by the Premise.

Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases.
   - Indian officials suspect that poultry could be smuggled through Myanmar from Thailand.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - Poultry smuggling from Thailand is the main way that disease and crime spreads to Myanmar.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise mentions that there are no reported H5N1 cases in Myanmar and that there is a suspicion of poultry smuggling from Thailand.
   - The Hypothesis makes a stronger claim, stating that poultry smuggling from Thailand is the main way that disease and crime spread to Myanmar.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the spread of disease and crime to Myanmar, nor does it confirm that poultry smuggling is the main way these issues spread.
   - The Premise only mentions a suspicion of smuggling, without confirming it as a fact or as the main cause of disease and crime.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis introduces additional information and makes a stronger claim that is not supported or refuted by the Premise. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Thus, the correct numerical value is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases"" indicates that there are no known cases of H5N1 in Myanmar.
   - ""Indian officials suspect that poultry could be SMUGGLED through Myanmar from Thailand"" suggests that there is a suspicion of illegal poultry movement from Thailand through Myanmar.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Myanmar has reported H5N1 cases"" directly contradicts the first part of the Premise, which states that there are no reported H5N1 cases in Myanmar.
   - ""Indian officials suspect that poultry could be removed from Myanmar to Thailand"" changes the direction of the suspected smuggling. The Premise suggests smuggling from Thailand through Myanmar, while the Hypothesis suggests smuggling from Myanmar to Thailand.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The first part of the Hypothesis (""Myanmar has reported H5N1 cases"") is in direct contradiction to the Premise (""Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases"").
   - The second part of the Hypothesis (""poultry could be removed from Myanmar to Thailand"") is different from the Premise, which states the suspicion is about smuggling from Thailand through Myanmar.

Given these points, the Hypothesis contradicts the Premise on two counts:
- The status of H5N1 cases in Myanmar.
- The direction of the suspected poultry smuggling.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

### Premise:
- Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases.
- Indian officials suspect that poultry could be smuggled through Myanmar from Thailand.

### Hypothesis:
- Indian officials suspect that poultry could be smuggled through Myanmar from Thailand.
- There's no reported H5N1 cases in Myanmar.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Content Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases.
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that Indian officials suspect poultry could be smuggled through Myanmar from Thailand.

2. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the information given in the Premise but does not alter its meaning.

3. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis restates the information provided in the Premise without adding any contradictory or uncertain elements, it is definitely true given the Premise.

### Conclusion:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that seven hundred passengers on a train were stranded for two hours.
   - After being stranded, they were guided through the tunnels to a safe place.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that after being stranded for two hours, the passengers were determined to find another way to get to work.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise focuses on the passengers being guided to a safe place after being stranded.
   - The hypothesis introduces a new element: the passengers' determination to find another way to get to work, which is not mentioned in the premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be an entailment, the information in the premise must directly support the hypothesis. In this case, the premise does not provide any information about the passengers' determination to find another way to get to work.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true based on the premise. The premise does not contradict the hypothesis, but it also does not provide enough information to confirm it. The passengers' determination to find another way to get to work is a plausible scenario but is not directly supported by the premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the hypothesis to be a contradiction, the information in the premise must directly oppose the hypothesis. In this case, the premise does not provide any information that contradicts the passengers' determination to find another way to get to work.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is **Neutral (1)** because the hypothesis introduces a new element that is not addressed in the premise, and there is no direct support or contradiction.

Final Answer:

caused-motion,schematic,"After the seven hundred passengers on the train were stranded for two hours , they were GUIDED through the tunnels to a safe place .","After the seven hundred passengers on the train were stranded for two hours , they were led away from the tunnels to a safe place .",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that seven hundred passengers on a train were stranded for two hours.
   - After being stranded, they were guided through the tunnels to a safe place.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that the same seven hundred passengers were stranded for two hours.
   - After being stranded, they were led away from the tunnels to a safe place.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis agree on the number of passengers, the fact that they were stranded for two hours, and that they were eventually taken to a safe place.
   - The key difference lies in the direction of movement relative to the tunnels:
     - The premise says they were guided ""through the tunnels.""
     - The hypothesis says they were led ""away from the tunnels.""

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The phrase ""through the tunnels"" implies movement within or along the tunnels.
   - The phrase ""away from the tunnels"" implies movement in the opposite direction, not within or along the tunnels.
   - These two directions are mutually exclusive; if they were guided through the tunnels, they could not simultaneously be led away from the tunnels.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise because the directions of movement described are opposite and cannot both be true simultaneously.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2

### Premise:
1. **Event**: Seven hundred passengers were stranded on the train.
2. **Duration**: The stranding lasted for two hours.
3. **Action**: After being stranded, the passengers were guided through the tunnels.
4. **Outcome**: The passengers reached a safe place.

### Hypothesis:
1. **Event**: Seven hundred passengers were stranded on the train.
2. **Duration**: The stranding lasted for two hours.
3. **Action**: After being stranded, the passengers were guided through the tunnels.
4. **Outcome**: The passengers reached a safe place.

- **Event**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention that seven hundred passengers were stranded on the train.
- **Duration**: Both statements agree that the stranding lasted for two hours.
- **Action**: Both statements indicate that after being stranded, the passengers were guided through the tunnels.
- **Outcome**: Both statements conclude that the passengers reached a safe place.

### Conclusion:
The Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise without adding or contradicting any details. The sequence of events and the outcomes are identical in both statements.

Given that the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the information provided in the Premise, the correct inference relation is:

caused-motion,schematic,If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they KICK you out the door talk to a retiree.,"If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once you retire, then check out how many retirees live in Florida.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

### Premise Analysis:
- The premise states that if someone thinks that Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are ""kicked out the door"" (which implies being forced out or discharged), they should talk to a retiree.
- The underlying implication is that retirees would confirm that the Marine Corps does not care about individuals once they are no longer part of the organization.

### Hypothesis Analysis:
- The hypothesis states that if someone thinks that Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them once they retire, they should check out how many retirees live in Florida.
- This statement suggests that the number of retirees living in Florida might provide some insight into whether the Marine Corps cares about retirees.

### Comparison:
1. **Premise Focus**: The premise focuses on the idea that the Marine Corps does not care about individuals once they are no longer part of the organization, as evidenced by talking to retirees.
2. **Hypothesis Focus**: The hypothesis suggests checking the number of retirees in Florida to understand if the Marine Corps cares about retirees.

### Key Points:
- The premise implies a negative sentiment about the Marine Corps' care for individuals after they leave.
- The hypothesis does not directly contradict this sentiment but suggests a method (checking retiree numbers in Florida) that might imply a different perspective.

### Conclusion:
- The hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise but introduces a different angle (geographical distribution of retirees) that is not addressed in the premise.
- The hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise, nor does it directly oppose it.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is best described as **Neutral** because the hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise, and it introduces a different aspect that is not directly addressed by the premise.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that if someone thinks that Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out, they should talk to a retiree.
   - This implies that talking to a retiree would provide insight or evidence that Headquarters Marine Corps does not care about them once they are kicked out.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that if someone thinks that Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out, they should not bother talking to a retiree.
   - This implies that talking to a retiree would be pointless or unnecessary in providing any new information about whether Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise suggests that talking to a retiree is a recommended action to understand the lack of care from Headquarters Marine Corps after being kicked out.
   - The hypothesis suggests the opposite: that talking to a retiree is not recommended or is pointless in this context.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The premise and the hypothesis present opposite recommendations regarding talking to a retiree.
   - Since the hypothesis directly contradicts the action suggested by the premise, the hypothesis cannot be true if the premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

caused-motion,schematic,If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they KICK you out the door talk to a retiree.,Talk to a retiree if any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they kick you out the door.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they KICK you out the door talk to a retiree.""
   - This sentence suggests that if someone believes that the Headquarters Marine Corps cares about them after they are kicked out, they should talk to a retiree to understand the reality.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Talk to a retiree if any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they kick you out the door.""
   - This sentence is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. It conveys the same conditional advice: if someone thinks the Marine Corps cares about them after being kicked out, they should talk to a retiree.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same conditional relationship and advice.
   - The structure and wording are slightly different, but the meaning remains unchanged.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a rephrased version of the Premise and conveys the same meaning, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

caused-motion,schematic,I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.,It is challenging for them to understand what is allowed to happen.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker expresses difficulty in understanding how a certain situation was allowed to occur.
   - Key phrases: ""I can't WRAP my head around"" (indicating confusion or difficulty in understanding) and ""how any of this was allowed to happen"" (referring to the occurrence of an event or situation).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that it is challenging for ""them"" to understand what is allowed to happen.
   - Key phrases: ""It is challenging"" (indicating difficulty) and ""to understand what is allowed to happen"" (referring to understanding the permissibility of events or situations).

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey a sense of difficulty in understanding.
   - The Premise is specific to the speaker (""I can't WRAP my head around""), while the Hypothesis generalizes to ""them"" (which could include the speaker or others).
   - The Premise focuses on a specific event or situation (""how any of this was allowed to happen""), while the Hypothesis is more general (""what is allowed to happen"").

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not directly contradict the Premise; it is plausible that if the speaker finds it challenging to understand a specific situation, they (or others) might also find it challenging to understand what is allowed to happen in general.
   - The Hypothesis is not definitively true based on the Premise alone, as the Premise is specific and the Hypothesis is more general.
   - The Hypothesis is not definitively false based on the Premise either.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as Neutral.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The speaker states, ""I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.""
   - This means the speaker is expressing confusion or lack of understanding about how the situation occurred.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states, ""I can understand perfectly how this was allowed to happen.""
   - This means the speaker is expressing clear understanding about how the situation occurred.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates a lack of understanding (""I can't WRAP my head around"").
   - The hypothesis indicates a clear understanding (""I can understand perfectly"").

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The premise and the hypothesis are expressing opposite states of understanding.
   - If the speaker in the premise cannot understand the situation, it directly contradicts the hypothesis where the speaker claims to understand it perfectly.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""I can't WRAP my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.""
   - This means the speaker is expressing confusion or disbelief about how a certain situation was permitted to occur.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""How any of this was allowed to happen, I can't wrap my head around.""
   - This is a rephrased version of the Premise, maintaining the same meaning but with a different word order.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same idea: the speaker is unable to understand how a particular situation was allowed to happen.
   - The rephrasing in the Hypothesis does not change the meaning or introduce any new information.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is simply a rephrased version of the Premise and retains the exact same meaning, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

caused-motion,schematic,The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.,The MiG-25 is well-equipped compared to the Predator.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information provided step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.""
   - This indicates that the MiG-25 launched an air-to-air missile (AAM) at the Predator.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The MiG-25 is well-equipped compared to the Predator.""
   - This suggests a comparison of the equipment or capabilities between the MiG-25 and the Predator.

3. **Inference Evaluation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise must provide clear evidence that the MiG-25 is well-equipped compared to the Predator. The Premise only mentions that the MiG-25 fired an AAM at the Predator, which does not necessarily imply that the MiG-25 is well-equipped overall. It only indicates that the MiG-25 has the capability to fire an AAM.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The fact that the MiG-25 fired an AAM at the Predator does not provide enough information to definitively conclude whether the MiG-25 is well-equipped compared to the Predator. There could be other factors or equipment that are not mentioned in the Premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to provide information that directly contradicts the idea that the MiG-25 is well-equipped compared to the Predator. The Premise does not provide such contradictory information.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

caused-motion,schematic,The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.,The MiG-25 ceased fire at the Predator.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.""
   - This means that the MiG-25 launched an air-to-air missile (AAM) targeting the Predator.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The MiG-25 ceased fire at the Predator.""
   - This means that the MiG-25 stopped firing at the Predator.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise indicates an action of firing a missile.
   - The Hypothesis indicates the cessation of firing.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - If the MiG-25 fired a missile, it implies that at some point it was actively engaging the Predator.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that the MiG-25 stopped engaging the Predator.
   - These two statements describe different actions: one is about initiating an attack, and the other is about stopping an attack.
   - The Hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the Premise. The Premise does not provide information about whether the MiG-25 continued or ceased firing after the initial action.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

caused-motion,schematic,The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.,The Predator had an AAM fired at them by the MiG-25.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The MiG-25 FIRED an AAM at the Predator.""
   - This means that the MiG-25 is the subject performing the action of firing an AAM (Air-to-Air Missile) towards the Predator.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The Predator had an AAM fired at them by the MiG-25.""
   - This means that the Predator is the recipient of the action, and the MiG-25 is the one performing the action of firing an AAM.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: the MiG-25 firing an AAM at the Predator.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the event described in the Premise but does not change the meaning or introduce any new information.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is simply a rephrased version of the Premise and does not contradict or add uncertainty to the event described, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
caused-motion,schematic,"Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.","Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base in Germany, where he stayed for weeks.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.""
   - Key information: Pope was flown to a specific U.S. military base located in Ramstein, Germany.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that ""Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base in Germany, where he stayed for weeks.""
   - Key information: Pope was flown to a U.S. military base in Germany and stayed there for weeks.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that Pope was flown to a U.S. military base in Germany.
   - The Premise specifies the exact location as Ramstein, Germany, while the Hypothesis does not specify the exact base but still mentions a U.S. military base in Germany.
   - The additional information in the Hypothesis is that Pope ""stayed for weeks,"" which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information (""stayed for weeks"") that is not present in the Premise. This new information is not contradicted by the Premise, but it is also not confirmed.
   - The location information in the Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise, as Ramstein is a U.S. military base in Germany.

Given that the Hypothesis introduces new information that is neither confirmed nor denied by the Premise, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.""
   - This indicates that Pope was transported by air to the specified location.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Pope didn't fly to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.""
   - This suggests that Pope did not travel by air to the specified location.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise asserts that Pope was flown to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.
   - The Hypothesis asserts the opposite, that Pope did not fly to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the Premise, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Pope was FLOWN to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.""
   - This indicates that an individual named Pope was transported by air to a specific location, which is the U.S. military base located at Ramstein, Germany.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""It was the military base at Ramstein, Germany that Pope was flown to.""
   - This rephrases the information given in the Premise, emphasizing the destination of Pope's flight as the military base at Ramstein, Germany.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same core information: Pope was flown to the military base at Ramstein, Germany.
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or adds uncertainty to the information provided in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new elements that would make it uncertain or contradictory.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis restates the information given in the Premise without any deviation, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that Schapelle Corby is Australian.
   - She was convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali.
   - She was jailed for 20 years.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that Schapelle Corby is Australian.
   - She got caught and was imprisoned.
   - The reason for her imprisonment was something illegal.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis agree that Schapelle Corby is Australian.
   - The premise specifies that she was convicted of trafficking marijuana, which is an illegal activity.
   - The hypothesis generalizes the reason for imprisonment as ""something illegal,"" which is consistent with the specific illegal activity mentioned in the premise (trafficking marijuana).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis does not contradict the premise; it is a generalization of the specific details provided in the premise.
   - The hypothesis is definitely true given the premise because trafficking marijuana is indeed an illegal activity, and being jailed for it aligns with being imprisoned for something illegal.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of ""TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali"" and was jailed for 20 years.
   - Key points: 
     - Conviction for trafficking marijuana.
     - The direction of trafficking is ""into Bali"".
     - The jail sentence is 20 years.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of ""removing marijuana from Bali"" and was jailed for 20 years.
   - Key points:
     - Conviction for removing marijuana.
     - The direction of the action is ""from Bali"".
     - The jail sentence is 20 years.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both statements agree on the identity of the person (Schapelle Corby) and the jail sentence (20 years).
   - The key difference lies in the nature and direction of the drug-related action:
     - Premise: Trafficking marijuana into Bali.
     - Hypothesis: Removing marijuana from Bali.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The action described in the hypothesis (removing marijuana from Bali) is fundamentally different from the action described in the premise (trafficking marijuana into Bali).
   - These actions are mutually exclusive; one cannot be true if the other is true because they describe opposite directions of movement.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis cannot be true if the premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction.

caused-motion,schematic,Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali and jailed for 20 years.,Australian Schapelle Corby was jailed for 20 years because he was convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that ""Australian Schapelle Corby was convicted of TRAFFICKING marijuana into Bali and jailed for 20 years.""
   - Key points: 
     - Schapelle Corby is Australian.
     - Convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali.
     - Jailed for 20 years.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that ""Australian Schapelle Corby was jailed for 20 years because he was convicted of trafficking marijuana into Bali.""
   - Key points:
     - Schapelle Corby is Australian.
     - Jailed for 20 years.
     - The reason for the jail sentence is the conviction of trafficking marijuana into Bali.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis mention that Schapelle Corby is Australian.
   - Both state that Schapelle Corby was jailed for 20 years.
   - Both agree that the reason for the jail sentence is the conviction of trafficking marijuana into Bali.

4. **Gender Pronoun**:
   - The hypothesis uses ""he"" while referring to Schapelle Corby, which is a discrepancy since Schapelle Corby is female. However, this discrepancy does not affect the factual content of the hypothesis in relation to the premise.

5. **Inference Relation**:
   - Despite the pronoun error, the factual content of the hypothesis is directly supported by the premise.
   - The hypothesis is definitely true given the premise, as all the key points match.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

caused-motion,schematic,The Pakistan-born man was then DEPORTED to the United Kingdom on 070713.,The man from Pakistan went against his will to the United Kingdom for a crime committed.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each part step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The Pakistan-born man was then DEPORTED to the United Kingdom on 070713.""
   - Key points: 
     - The man is from Pakistan.
     - He was deported to the United Kingdom.
     - The deportation occurred on 070713 (presumably a date).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The man from Pakistan went against his will to the United Kingdom for a crime committed.""
   - Key points:
     - The man is from Pakistan.
     - He went to the United Kingdom against his will.
     - The reason for going to the United Kingdom is implied to be due to a crime committed.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that the man is from Pakistan and that he went to the United Kingdom.
   - The Premise states that the man was ""deported,"" which generally implies being sent against one's will, aligning with the Hypothesis's claim that he went ""against his will.""
   - The Premise does not explicitly state the reason for deportation, while the Hypothesis suggests it was due to a crime committed.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not provide information about the reason for deportation, so we cannot definitively conclude that the man was deported due to a crime.
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information (the crime) that is not present in the Premise.

Given that the Premise does not confirm or deny the reason for deportation, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""The Pakistan-born man was then DEPORTED to the United Kingdom on 070713.""
   - Key information: The man was deported to the United Kingdom on a specific date (070713).

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that ""The Pakistan-born man was then allowed to stay in the United Kingdom on 070713.""
   - Key information: The man was allowed to stay in the United Kingdom on the same date (070713).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The term ""deported"" in the Premise implies that the man was forced to leave a country and sent to the United Kingdom.
   - The term ""allowed to stay"" in the Hypothesis implies that the man was permitted to remain in the United Kingdom.

4. **Inference**:
   - Being ""deported"" and being ""allowed to stay"" are contradictory actions. If someone is deported, they are not allowed to stay; they are being sent away.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The statement is: ""The Pakistan-born man was then DEPORTED to the United Kingdom on 070713.""
   - This means that a man who was born in Pakistan was deported to the United Kingdom on the date 070713.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The statement is: ""On 070713 the Pakistan-born man was then deported to the United Kingdom.""
   - This means that on the date 070713, a man who was born in Pakistan was deported to the United Kingdom.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same information: a Pakistan-born man was deported to the United Kingdom on the date 070713.
   - The order of the information is slightly different, but the meaning is identical.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they are essentially restating the same fact), the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

caused-motion,schematic,The pilot refused to ALLOW the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.,The Pakistan-born man was a threat to the pilot on the pilot's plane.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""The pilot refused to ALLOW the Pakistan-born man onto the pilot's plane.""
   - This indicates that the pilot did not permit the Pakistan-born man to board the plane. The reason for this refusal is not explicitly stated in the premise.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""The Pakistan-born man was a threat to the pilot on the pilot's plane.""
   - This suggests that the Pakistan-born man posed a danger or risk to the pilot.

3. **Inference Evaluation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be definitely true given the premise, the premise must provide clear evidence that the Pakistan-born man was a threat to the pilot. However, the premise does not specify the reason for the pilot's refusal. It could be due to various reasons unrelated to being a threat.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny that the Pakistan-born man was a threat. The refusal could be based on other factors such as security protocols, personal biases, or other reasons.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the hypothesis to be definitely false given the premise, the premise would need to provide information that directly contradicts the idea that the Pakistan-born man was a threat. The premise does not provide such information.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is **Neutral (1)** because the premise does not provide sufficient information to determine whether the Pakistan-born man was a threat or not.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - China confirmed on January 23, 2007.
   - There was a 12-day period of silence before the confirmation.
   - China fired a guided missile into space.
   - The purpose of the missile was to destroy one of its satellites.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - China confirmed on January 23, 2007.
   - There was a 12-day period of silence before the confirmation.
   - China fired a guided missile into space.
   - The missile is specified as JL-2 ""Ju Lang"" 2.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree on the date of confirmation (January 23, 2007) and the 12-day period of silence.
   - Both agree that China fired a guided missile into space.
   - The Premise specifies that the missile was used to destroy one of its satellites, while the Hypothesis does not mention the purpose of the missile.
   - The Hypothesis specifies the missile as JL-2 ""Ju Lang"" 2, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis provides additional detail (the specific missile model) that is not present in the Premise.
   - The additional detail does not contradict the Premise; it is possible that the missile mentioned in the Premise could be the JL-2 ""Ju Lang"" 2.
   - The purpose of the missile (destroying a satellite) mentioned in the Premise is not contradicted by the Hypothesis, but it is not confirmed either.

Given that the Hypothesis introduces new information that is not contradicted by the Premise but is also not explicitly confirmed, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Date**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis mention the same date, January 23, 2007.
   - **Action**: The Premise states that China confirmed the event, while the Hypothesis states that China denied the event.
   - **Event**: Both the Premise and the Hypothesis refer to the same event (firing a guided missile into space to destroy a satellite).
   - **Context**: The Premise mentions ""12 days of silence,"" while the Hypothesis mentions ""12 days of noise."" This difference in context does not affect the core contradiction between ""confirmed"" and ""denied.""

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Premise states that China confirmed the event.
   - The Hypothesis states that China denied the event.
   - These two statements are directly contradictory because one cannot both confirm and deny the same event at the same time.

causative-with-CxN,partial,Kevin lifted the trumpet and filled the room with happy noise.,Kevin lifted the trumpet and played to an audience that filled the room.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Kevin lifted the trumpet and filled the room with happy noise.""
   - This indicates that Kevin did something with the trumpet that resulted in the room being filled with happy noise. It implies that Kevin played the trumpet, but it does not specify the presence of an audience.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Kevin lifted the trumpet and played to an audience that filled the room.""
   - This statement suggests that Kevin not only played the trumpet but also did so in front of an audience that filled the room.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise confirms that Kevin lifted the trumpet and produced happy noise, but it does not mention an audience.
   - The Hypothesis adds the detail of an audience filling the room, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must provide enough information to confirm the Hypothesis as definitely true. Since the Premise does not mention an audience, we cannot be certain that the Hypothesis is true based on the Premise alone.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not rule out the possibility of an audience, but it also does not confirm it. Therefore, the Hypothesis could be true, but it is not guaranteed by the Premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must provide information that directly conflicts with the Hypothesis. Since the Premise does not mention anything that would make the presence of an audience impossible, there is no direct contradiction.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

   - This indicates that Kevin's action of lifting the trumpet resulted in the room being filled with happy noise.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Kevin lowered the trumpet and filled the room with silence.""
   - This suggests that Kevin's action of lowering the trumpet resulted in the room being filled with silence.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes an action (lifting the trumpet) that produces a specific outcome (happy noise).
   - The Hypothesis describes a different action (lowering the trumpet) that produces a different outcome (silence).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are opposite (lifting vs. lowering).
   - The outcomes described in the Premise and Hypothesis are also opposite (happy noise vs. silence).
   - Given that the actions and outcomes are directly opposed, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:

   - This means that Kevin picked up the trumpet and as a result, the room was filled with happy noise.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Kevin lifted the trumpet and made happy noise in the room.""
   - This means that Kevin picked up the trumpet and produced happy noise in the room.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis state that Kevin lifted the trumpet.
   - The Premise says that the room was filled with happy noise, implying that the noise was significant and pervasive.
   - The Hypothesis says that Kevin made happy noise in the room, which is a slightly less specific way of saying the same thing.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise; it is consistent with the idea that Kevin's action of lifting the trumpet resulted in happy noise in the room.
   - The Hypothesis is a bit less specific but does not introduce any new information that would make it uncertain or contradictory.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. Therefore, the relation is:

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""A man filled the room with sweet things for his significant other.""
   - Key elements: ""A man"" (subject), ""filled the room"" (action), ""sweet things"" (items), ""for his significant other"" (purpose).

3. **Comparison**:
   - **Subject**: ""Dude"" in the premise is equivalent to ""A man"" in the hypothesis.
   - **Action**: Both the premise and the hypothesis describe the action of filling the room.
   - **Items**: The premise specifies ""flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards,"" which can be considered ""sweet things"" in a broader sense.
   - **Purpose**: The premise does not explicitly state the purpose, but the items mentioned (flowers, teddy bears, and cheesy cards) are commonly associated with romantic gestures, which aligns with the hypothesis's implication of doing it ""for his significant other.""

4. **Inference**:
   - The hypothesis introduces the idea that the action was done ""for his significant other,"" which is not explicitly stated in the premise but is a reasonable assumption given the context of the items mentioned.
   - The hypothesis does not contradict the premise; rather, it adds a plausible detail that is not directly confirmed but is consistent with the premise.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is not definitively true based on the premise alone, but it is a reasonable and plausible interpretation. Therefore, the relationship is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Final answer:

   - The Hypothesis introduces new details that are not mentioned or implied in the Premise.

Given that the Premise does not confirm or deny the specific details provided in the Hypothesis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information given in the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,The Grateful Dead have flooded the market with excellent live material.,The Grateful Dead have not released any good live material on the market.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The Grateful Dead have flooded the market with excellent live material.""
   - This means that the Grateful Dead have released a large amount of high-quality live recordings.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The Grateful Dead have not released any good live material on the market.""
   - This means that the Grateful Dead have not released any live recordings that are considered good.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise asserts that there is a large quantity of excellent (high-quality) live material released by the Grateful Dead.
   - The Hypothesis asserts that there is no good (high-quality) live material released by the Grateful Dead.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - If the Premise is true (the Grateful Dead have released a lot of excellent live material), then the Hypothesis (the Grateful Dead have not released any good live material) cannot be true.
   - The statements are directly contradictory because the existence of ""excellent live material"" implies the presence of ""good live material,"" which the Hypothesis denies.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,The Grateful Dead have flooded the market with excellent live material.,Excellent live material has flooded the market from The Grateful Dead.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The Grateful Dead have flooded the market with excellent live material.""
   - This means that The Grateful Dead have released a large amount of high-quality live recordings into the market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Excellent live material has flooded the market from The Grateful Dead.""
   - This means that a large amount of high-quality live recordings from The Grateful Dead has been released into the market.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same information: The Grateful Dead are responsible for releasing a significant amount of excellent live material into the market.
   - The structure of the sentences is different, but the meaning is essentially the same.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they both state the same fact in different words), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.,"Samsung has flooded the market with tasteful, funny ads.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.""
   - This means that Samsung has released a large amount of advertising into the market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Samsung has flooded the market with tasteful, funny ads.""
   - This means that the ads released by Samsung are described as ""tasteful"" and ""funny.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise does not provide any information about the nature or quality of the ads (whether they are tasteful or funny).
   - The hypothesis adds additional information about the ads being ""tasteful"" and ""funny,"" which is not mentioned in the premise.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - Since the premise only states that Samsung has flooded the market with advertising, it does not confirm or deny the specific qualities of the ads mentioned in the hypothesis.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information given in the premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral

The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise.",The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise.,False,False,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.,Samsung has held back with their advertising.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.""
   - This implies that Samsung has extensively and aggressively advertised their products, suggesting a high volume and frequency of advertisements.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Samsung has held back with their advertising.""
   - This implies that Samsung has been restrained or conservative in their advertising efforts, suggesting a low volume and frequency of advertisements.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates a high level of advertising (""flooded the market"").
   - The hypothesis indicates a low level of advertising (""held back"").

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The two statements present opposite scenarios regarding Samsung's advertising efforts.
   - If Samsung has indeed ""flooded the market"" with advertising, it is impossible for them to have ""held back"" at the same time.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.,The market is flooded with Samsung's advertising.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Samsung has flooded the market with their advertising.""
   - This means that Samsung has extensively advertised, resulting in a market saturated with their advertisements.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The market is flooded with Samsung's advertising.""
   - This means that the market is saturated with advertisements from Samsung.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same idea: the market is saturated with Samsung's advertisements.
   - The Premise provides the cause (Samsung's actions) and the result (market saturation), while the Hypothesis focuses on the result (market saturation).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the Premise, the Hypothesis is definitely true because the information in the Premise directly supports the statement in the Hypothesis.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

0 – Entailment: The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.,Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil that was sold to at least five countries.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information provided in each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states that ""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.""
   - Key points:
     - Saudi Arabia took an action (flooding the market with cheap oil).
     - The purpose of this action was to recover their market share.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states that ""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil that was sold to at least five countries.""
   - Key points:
     - Saudi Arabia took an action (flooding the market with cheap oil).
     - The oil was sold to at least five countries.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree on the action taken by Saudi Arabia (flooding the market with cheap oil).
   - The Premise does not specify the number of countries to which the oil was sold.
   - The Hypothesis introduces additional information (the oil was sold to at least five countries) that is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information that is not explicitly stated in the Premise.
   - The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the specific detail about the number of countries.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.,Saudi reduced the market's supply of cheap oil so they could deteriorate their market share.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.""
   - This means that Saudi Arabia increased the supply of cheap oil in the market with the intention of regaining or increasing their market share.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""Saudi reduced the market's supply of cheap oil so they could deteriorate their market share.""
   - This means that Saudi Arabia decreased the supply of cheap oil in the market with the intention of reducing or losing their market share.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise states that Saudi Arabia increased the supply of cheap oil to recover their market share.
   - The Hypothesis states that Saudi Arabia decreased the supply of cheap oil to deteriorate their market share.

4. **Contradiction Check:**
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are opposite: increasing supply vs. decreasing supply.
   - The intentions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are also opposite: recovering market share vs. deteriorating market share.

Given these points, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise in both the action taken (flooding the market vs. reducing supply) and the intended outcome (recovering market share vs. deteriorating market share).

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.,"To recover their market share, Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil then so they could recover their market share.""
   - This statement indicates that Saudi Arabia's action of flooding the market with cheap oil was done with the intention of recovering their market share.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""To recover their market share, Saudi flooded the market with cheap oil.""
   - This statement suggests that the reason Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap oil was to recover their market share.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same causal relationship: Saudi Arabia's action (flooding the market with cheap oil) was motivated by the goal of recovering their market share.
   - The order of the phrases is different, but the meaning remains the same.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis restates the Premise in a different order but with the same meaning, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.,"The Chinese have the largest, juiciest apples on the market.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.""
   - This means that the Chinese have introduced a large quantity of apples suitable for making juice into the market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The Chinese have the largest, juiciest apples on the market.""
   - This implies that the Chinese apples are not only abundant but also the largest and juiciest available.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise focuses on the quantity and type (juice-grade) of apples the Chinese have introduced to the market.
   - The Hypothesis makes a qualitative claim about the size and juiciness of the apples, which is not addressed in the Premise.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the size or juiciness of the apples, only that they are juice-grade and abundant.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis could be true or false based on the information given in the Premise. There is no direct contradiction, but there is also no support for the specific qualitative claims made in the Hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Thus, the final answer is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.,The Chinese already have under produced in the market with juice-grade apples.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.""
   - This means that there is an abundance or oversupply of juice-grade apples in the market due to Chinese production.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""The Chinese already have under produced in the market with juice-grade apples.""
   - This means that there is a shortage or insufficient supply of juice-grade apples in the market due to Chinese production.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise states that there is an oversupply (flooded the market).
   - The Hypothesis states that there is an undersupply (under produced).

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - The two statements are directly contradictory. If the market is flooded with juice-grade apples, it cannot simultaneously be under produced. Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.,Juice-grade apples have already been flooded in the market by the Chinese.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade apples.""
   - This statement indicates that the Chinese have introduced a large quantity of juice-grade apples into the market.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Juice-grade apples have already been flooded in the market by the Chinese.""
   - This statement is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise. It conveys the same information: the Chinese have introduced a large quantity of juice-grade apples into the market.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis convey the same event: the Chinese flooding the market with juice-grade apples.
   - The structure of the sentences is different, but the meaning is identical.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise (they are essentially restating the same fact), the relationship is one of Entailment.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.,He turned his face to the wall and covered it out of embarrassment.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.""
   - This statement describes an action where a person turns to face the wall and then covers their face with a pillow.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He turned his face to the wall and covered it out of embarrassment.""
   - This statement describes a similar action where a person turns to face the wall and covers their face, but it adds a reason for the action: embarrassment.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the action of turning to the wall and covering the face.
   - The Premise does not provide any reason for the action.
   - The Hypothesis introduces a specific reason (embarrassment) for the action.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, the Premise must definitively imply the Hypothesis. In this case, the Premise does not provide any information about the reason for the action, so it cannot definitively imply that the action was due to embarrassment.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not contradict the Hypothesis, but it also does not provide enough information to confirm it. The reason for the action (embarrassment) is not mentioned in the Premise, so it remains a possibility but not a certainty.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, the Premise must make the Hypothesis impossible. Since the Premise does not provide any reason for the action, it does not contradict the possibility that the action was due to embarrassment.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate inference relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the answer is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.,Turning away fromt he wall he uncovered his face with a pillow.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.""
   - This means the subject is facing the wall and has used a pillow to cover their face.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Turning away from the wall he uncovered his face with a pillow.""
   - This means the subject is facing away from the wall and has removed the pillow from their face.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise states that the subject is facing the wall and has their face covered with a pillow.
   - The Hypothesis states that the subject is facing away from the wall and has their face uncovered.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict the actions described in the Premise.
   - In the Premise, the subject is facing the wall and has their face covered.
   - In the Hypothesis, the subject is facing away from the wall and has their face uncovered.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

The correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.,He covered his face with a pillow as he turned toward the wall.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow.""
   - This sentence describes two actions: turning to the wall and covering his face with a pillow. The sequence of actions is important here.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He covered his face with a pillow as he turned toward the wall.""
   - This sentence also describes the same two actions: turning toward the wall and covering his face with a pillow. However, it suggests that these actions are happening simultaneously or in a slightly different sequence.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise suggests that he turned to the wall first and then covered his face with a pillow.
   - The Hypothesis suggests that he covered his face with a pillow while turning toward the wall, implying simultaneity or a different sequence.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be an entailment, it must be definitely true given the Premise. The Premise does not explicitly state that the actions are simultaneous, so we cannot be certain that the Hypothesis is definitely true.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not rule out the possibility that he covered his face with a pillow while turning toward the wall. The sequence of actions in the Hypothesis is plausible but not definitively stated in the Premise.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be a contradiction, it must be impossible given the Premise. The Premise does not make it impossible for the actions to occur as described in the Hypothesis.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,"The school filled his head with knowledge, challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.","The school imparted pertinent, real-world knowledge and challenged him with tests, quizzes and homework.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The school filled his head with knowledge.
   - The school challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The school imparted pertinent, real-world knowledge.
   - The school challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis agree that the school challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.
   - The difference lies in the description of the knowledge imparted:
     - The Premise states that the school filled his head with knowledge.
     - The Hypothesis specifies that the knowledge was pertinent and real-world.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not specify the nature of the knowledge (whether it is pertinent or real-world), only that it filled his head with knowledge.
   - The Hypothesis adds a specific quality to the knowledge (pertinent and real-world) that is not explicitly mentioned in the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the Premise because the Premise does not provide enough information about the nature of the knowledge. Therefore, the relationship is:

1 – Neutral

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The school filled his head with knowledge.
   - The school challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The school emptied his head of knowledge.
   - The school eased him with tests, quizzes, and homework.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The first part of the Premise states that the school ""filled his head with knowledge,"" which means he gained knowledge.
   - The first part of the Hypothesis states that the school ""emptied his head of knowledge,"" which means he lost knowledge. This is directly opposite to the Premise.
   - The second part of the Premise states that the school ""challenged him with tests, quizzes, and homework,"" indicating difficulty and effort.
   - The second part of the Hypothesis states that the school ""eased him with tests, quizzes, and homework,"" indicating a lack of difficulty and effort. This is also directly opposite to the Premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise in both parts. The actions described in the Hypothesis are the exact opposites of those described in the Premise.

   - The order of these points is different, but the content is identical.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Hypothesis is essentially a rephrasing of the Premise with the same information presented in a different order.
   - Since the Hypothesis contains no additional information that contradicts the Premise and is fully supported by the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,"Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.","Susan was a trapper by trade, specializing in mink hats.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.""
   - This statement suggests that Susan deceived someone (referred to as ""him"") and manipulated him by telling lies. The word ""trapped"" here is used metaphorically to indicate deception rather than literal trapping.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Susan was a trapper by trade, specializing in mink hats.""
   - This statement suggests that Susan's profession is trapping animals, specifically for making mink hats. It implies a literal interpretation of the word ""trapper.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise uses ""trapped"" in a metaphorical sense related to deception.
   - The Hypothesis uses ""trapper"" in a literal sense related to a profession.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The Premise does not provide any information about Susan's profession or any activities related to trapping animals or making mink hats.
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information that is not implied or suggested by the Premise.

Given that the Premise and Hypothesis discuss different contexts (metaphorical deception vs. literal profession), the truth of the Hypothesis cannot be determined based on the Premise alone. The Premise does not support or contradict the Hypothesis directly.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

causative-with-CxN,partial,"Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.","Susan let him free, cleared his head of lies.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""Susan trapped him"": This indicates that Susan confined or restricted him in some way.
   - ""filled his head with lies"": This suggests that Susan deceived him by telling him false information.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""Susan let him free"": This indicates that Susan released him from confinement or restriction.
   - ""cleared his head of lies"": This suggests that Susan removed the false information she had previously given him.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise states that Susan trapped him and filled his head with lies.
   - The Hypothesis states the opposite actions: Susan let him free and cleared his head of lies.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - The actions described in the Hypothesis directly contradict the actions described in the Premise.
   - If Susan trapped him, she did not let him free.
   - If Susan filled his head with lies, she did not clear his head of lies.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,"Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.","Susan filled his head with lies, trapped him.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Susan trapped him, filled his head with lies.""
   - This indicates two actions performed by Susan: trapping him and filling his head with lies.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Susan filled his head with lies, trapped him.""
   - This also indicates the same two actions performed by Susan: filling his head with lies and trapping him.

3. **Order of Actions**:
   - The only difference between the Premise and the Hypothesis is the order in which the actions are mentioned.
   - In the Premise, the order is: trapped him first, then filled his head with lies.
   - In the Hypothesis, the order is: filled his head with lies first, then trapped him.

4. **Impact of Order on Truth**:
   - The order of actions does not change the fact that both actions occurred.
   - The Hypothesis does not contradict the Premise because it does not deny any of the actions mentioned in the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis does not add any new information that would make it uncertain or neutral.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the Hypothesis simply reorders the actions but maintains the same facts as the Premise, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,"They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.",They made him take pills that were supposed to ease his headache.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.""
   - This statement indicates that the pills had a specific effect on him, which was filling his head with ""cold, silent noise."" This suggests an adverse or unusual effect of the pills.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""They made him take pills that were supposed to ease his headache.""
   - This statement suggests that the purpose of the pills was to alleviate a headache. It implies an intended positive effect of the pills.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise describes the actual effect of the pills as filling his head with ""cold, silent noise,"" which does not directly indicate that the pills were intended to ease a headache.
   - The Hypothesis describes the intended purpose of the pills as easing a headache, which is not mentioned in the Premise.

4. **Inference Determination:**
   - The Premise does not provide any information about the intended purpose of the pills, only their actual effect.
   - The Hypothesis introduces new information about the intended purpose of the pills, which is not confirmed or denied by the Premise.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the Premise. There is no direct contradiction or confirmation.

Therefore, the relation is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,"They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.","They made him give away pills that emptied his head of cold, silent noise.",2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""They made him take pills"" indicates that someone forced him to ingest pills.
   - ""that filled his head with cold, silent noise"" describes the effect of the pills, which is to fill his head with a sensation of cold, silent noise.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""They made him give away pills"" indicates that someone forced him to distribute or hand out pills, not ingest them.
   - ""that emptied his head of cold, silent noise"" describes the effect of the pills, which is to remove the sensation of cold, silent noise from his head.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The actions described in the Premise and Hypothesis are different: taking pills vs. giving away pills.
   - The effects described are also opposite: filling his head with noise vs. emptying his head of noise.

4. **Inference Determination:**
   - The Premise states that the pills filled his head with noise, while the Hypothesis states that the pills emptied his head of noise. These effects are contradictory.
   - Additionally, the actions (taking vs. giving away) are different and imply different scenarios.

Given these points, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true because the actions and effects described are directly opposed.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,"They made him take pills that filled his head with cold, silent noise.","His head was filled with cold, silent noise from pills they made him take.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the content step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""They made him take pills"" indicates that someone forced or required him to consume pills.
   - ""that filled his head with cold, silent noise"" describes the effect of the pills, which is that his head was filled with a sensation described as ""cold, silent noise.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""His head was filled with cold, silent noise"" repeats the effect described in the premise.
   - ""from pills they made him take"" specifies the source of the effect, which is the pills that were administered to him by others.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: the administration of pills by others and the resulting sensation in his head.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise but does not introduce any new information or contradict the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise, as it restates the cause (pills) and the effect (cold, silent noise in his head).

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.,"There are other teachers, but one was trying to conceal her body with a sheet.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.""
   - This indicates that there is at least one teacher who took action to cover someone's body with a black sheet.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""There are other teachers, but one was trying to conceal her body with a sheet.""
   - This suggests that there are multiple teachers, and one specific teacher was attempting to conceal someone's body with a sheet.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise mentions ""one of the teachers,"" which implies the existence of more than one teacher. This aligns with the hypothesis stating ""there are other teachers.""
   - The action described in the premise (""covered her body with a black sheet"") is consistent with the action described in the hypothesis (""trying to conceal her body with a sheet"").

4. **Inference**:
   - The hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the premise.
   - The hypothesis is a rephrasing of the premise with additional context about the presence of other teachers, which is implied but not explicitly stated in the premise.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.,One of the teachers left after removing a black sheet from her body.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that ""One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.""
   - This means that a teacher approached and placed a black sheet over someone's body.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states that ""One of the teachers left after removing a black sheet from her body.""
   - This implies that a teacher departed after taking a black sheet off from her own body.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise describes an action where a teacher covers someone else's body with a black sheet.
   - The hypothesis describes an action where a teacher removes a black sheet from her own body and then leaves.

4. **Inference**:
   - The actions described in the premise and the hypothesis are different. The premise involves covering someone else's body, while the hypothesis involves removing a sheet from the teacher's own body.
   - These actions are not compatible; the hypothesis cannot be true if the premise is true because the premise does not mention the teacher removing a sheet from her own body or leaving.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.,One of the teachers covered her body with a black sheet after she came along.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""One of the teachers came along and covered her body with a black sheet.""
   - This sentence describes two actions performed by one of the teachers: first, the teacher ""came along,"" and second, the teacher ""covered her body with a black sheet.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""One of the teachers covered her body with a black sheet after she came along.""
   - This sentence also describes two actions performed by one of the teachers: first, the teacher ""came along,"" and second, the teacher ""covered her body with a black sheet."" The word ""after"" explicitly indicates the sequence of these actions.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same two actions performed by the teacher.
   - The sequence of actions is the same in both sentences: the teacher ""came along"" first and then ""covered her body with a black sheet.""
   - There is no additional information in the Hypothesis that contradicts or adds uncertainty to the information provided in the Premise.

Given that the Hypothesis is definitely true based on the information provided in the Premise, the correct relation is:

0 – Entailment

Therefore, the final answer is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,Howze filled her house with music and color.,Howze was the best roommate she had ever had.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information provided in each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Howze filled her house with music and color.""
   - This tells us that Howze is someone who brings music and color into her living space. It suggests that Howze has a vibrant and possibly artistic personality.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Howze was the best roommate she had ever had.""
   - This statement is an evaluative judgment about Howze as a roommate, indicating that the speaker considers Howze to be the best among all the roommates she has had.

3. **Comparison and Inference**:
   - The premise provides specific information about Howze's actions (filling the house with music and color) but does not provide any comparative or evaluative information about Howze as a roommate.
   - The hypothesis makes a comparative and evaluative statement about Howze being the best roommate, which is not directly supported or contradicted by the premise.

4. **Determining the Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be entailed by the premise, the premise must provide sufficient information to conclude that Howze is the best roommate. The premise does not provide such comparative information.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the hypothesis. It is possible that Howze's actions (filling the house with music and color) contribute to her being considered the best roommate, but this is not explicitly stated.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the hypothesis to be contradicted by the premise, the premise must provide information that directly conflicts with the hypothesis. There is no such conflicting information in the premise.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,Howze filled her house with music and color.,Howze emptied her house of music and color.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Howze filled her house with music and color.""
   - This means that Howze added music and color to her house, making it full of these elements.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Howze emptied her house of music and color.""
   - This means that Howze removed music and color from her house, making it devoid of these elements.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates an action of adding music and color to the house.
   - The Hypothesis indicates an action of removing music and color from the house.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are directly opposite to each other.
   - If Howze filled her house with music and color, it is logically impossible for the house to be emptied of music and color at the same time.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

The correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Howze filled her house with music and color.,The house was filled with music and color by Howze.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Howze filled her house with music and color.""
   - This means that Howze is the agent who performed the action of filling her house with music and color.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""The house was filled with music and color by Howze.""
   - This is a passive construction of the same action described in the Premise. It indicates that the house was filled with music and color, and the agent performing the action is Howze.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: Howze filling her house with music and color.
   - The only difference is the grammatical structure: the Premise uses an active voice, while the Hypothesis uses a passive voice.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is simply a rephrasing of the Premise and conveys the exact same information, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

0 – Entailment

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.,The red wine bottle was opened by him and he poured her a glass full of it.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""The cork came out with a pleasant pop"": This suggests that a bottle, likely a wine bottle, was opened.
   - ""he filled her glass with the rich red liquid"": This indicates that a man poured a red liquid, which is likely red wine, into a woman's glass.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""The red wine bottle was opened by him"": This suggests that a man opened a bottle of red wine.
   - ""he poured her a glass full of it"": This indicates that the man poured the red wine into a woman's glass.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a man opening a bottle and pouring a red liquid into a woman's glass.
   - The Premise does not explicitly state that the liquid is wine, but it is strongly implied by the context (cork, pleasant pop, rich red liquid).
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states that the liquid is red wine.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - The Hypothesis is a more specific version of the Premise, but it does not introduce any information that contradicts the Premise.
   - Given the context and common knowledge, it is reasonable to infer that the ""rich red liquid"" in the Premise is indeed red wine.

Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

The relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.,The cork came out with a horrible pop and he emptied her glass of the rich red liquid.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""The cork came out with a pleasant pop"" indicates a positive experience with the cork removal.
   - ""He filled her glass with the rich red liquid"" suggests that the glass was empty before and is now filled with a red liquid, likely wine.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""The cork came out with a horrible pop"" indicates a negative experience with the cork removal, which directly contradicts the ""pleasant pop"" in the Premise.
   - ""He emptied her glass of the rich red liquid"" suggests that the glass was full before and is now empty, which directly contradicts the action of filling the glass in the Premise.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The description of the cork removal in the Hypothesis (""horrible pop"") directly contradicts the description in the Premise (""pleasant pop"").
   - The action described in the Hypothesis (""emptied her glass"") directly contradicts the action in the Premise (""filled her glass"").

Given these direct contradictions in both the description of the cork removal and the action involving the glass, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true.

Therefore, the relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid.,He filled her glass with the rich red liquid that came from opening the cork with a pleasant pop.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the content step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The cork came out with a pleasant pop"" indicates that a cork was removed and it made a pleasant sound.
   - ""He filled her glass with the rich red liquid"" indicates that after the cork was removed, he poured a rich red liquid into her glass.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""He filled her glass with the rich red liquid"" is consistent with the second part of the premise.
   - ""that came from opening the cork with a pleasant pop"" suggests that the rich red liquid was poured as a result of the cork being removed with a pleasant pop.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Hypothesis essentially rephrases the Premise, adding a causal link between the cork being removed and the liquid being poured.
   - The Premise does not explicitly state that the rich red liquid came from the bottle that was opened with the cork, but it is a reasonable inference given the sequence of events described.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise.
   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise, as it is reasonable to infer that the rich red liquid came from the bottle that was opened with the cork.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,The waiter filled her glass with white wine.,She ordered the white wine in a glass.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""The waiter filled her glass with white wine.""
   - This means that there is a glass, it belongs to a female, and it is filled with white wine by a waiter.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""She ordered the white wine in a glass.""
   - This implies that the female mentioned in the hypothesis ordered white wine and it was served in a glass.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise does not provide any information about whether the female ordered the white wine. It only states that the waiter filled her glass with white wine.
   - The hypothesis introduces the idea that she ordered the white wine, which is not mentioned or implied in the premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be an entailment, the premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true. In this case, the premise does not confirm that she ordered the white wine; it only states that her glass was filled with it.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny that she ordered the white wine. It is possible that she ordered it, but it is also possible that someone else ordered it for her, or it was given to her without her ordering.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the hypothesis to be a contradiction, the premise must provide information that directly conflicts with the hypothesis. In this case, there is no direct conflict; the premise does not state anything that would make the hypothesis impossible.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:
1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,The waiter filled her glass with white wine.,The waiter emptied her glass of white wine.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The waiter filled her glass with white wine.""
   - This means that the glass, which was presumably empty or not full, is now filled with white wine by the waiter.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""The waiter emptied her glass of white wine.""
   - This means that the glass, which had white wine in it, is now emptied by the waiter.

3. **Comparing the Statements**:
   - The Premise states that the glass is filled with white wine.
   - The Hypothesis states that the glass is emptied of white wine.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - If the glass is filled with white wine (Premise), it cannot simultaneously be emptied of white wine (Hypothesis).
   - These two actions are mutually exclusive; if one is true, the other cannot be true at the same time.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,The waiter filled her glass with white wine.,Her glass was filled with white wine by the waiter.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The statement is: ""The waiter filled her glass with white wine.""
   - This means that there is a waiter who performed the action of filling a glass that belongs to a female (her) with white wine.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The statement is: ""Her glass was filled with white wine by the waiter.""
   - This is a passive construction of the same action described in the premise. It indicates that the glass belonging to a female was filled with white wine, and the action was performed by the waiter.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: a waiter filling a glass with white wine.
   - The only difference is the grammatical structure: the Premise uses an active voice (""The waiter filled...""), while the Hypothesis uses a passive voice (""Her glass was filled... by the waiter"").

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is simply a rephrasing of the Premise and conveys the exact same information, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct inference relation is:

causative-with-CxN,partial,Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.,"After filling her pockets with rocks, Virginia Woolf walked into a river famous for its clear waters.",1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the information provided in both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.""
   - This provides two key pieces of information:
     - Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks.
     - Virginia Woolf walked into a river.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""After filling her pockets with rocks, Virginia Woolf walked into a river famous for its clear waters.""
   - This hypothesis adds an additional detail to the premise:
     - The river into which Virginia Woolf walked is famous for its clear waters.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise does not specify any characteristics of the river, such as it being famous for its clear waters.
   - The hypothesis introduces a new detail (the river being famous for its clear waters) that is not mentioned in the premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be an entailment, the premise must provide enough information to definitively conclude the hypothesis. Since the premise does not mention anything about the river's characteristics, we cannot definitively conclude that the river is famous for its clear waters.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise does not provide information about the river's characteristics, so it is possible that the river could be famous for its clear waters, but it is also possible that it is not.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the hypothesis to be a contradiction, the premise must provide information that directly conflicts with the hypothesis. Since the premise does not provide any information about the river's characteristics, there is no direct conflict.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate inference relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.,Virginia Woolf emptied her pockets of rocks and walked away from the river.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.""
   - This statement indicates that Virginia Woolf took an action of filling her pockets with rocks and then proceeded to walk into a river.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Virginia Woolf emptied her pockets of rocks and walked away from the river.""
   - This statement suggests that Virginia Woolf took an action of emptying her pockets of rocks and then walked away from the river.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise describes Virginia Woolf walking into the river with rocks in her pockets.
   - The Hypothesis describes Virginia Woolf walking away from the river after emptying her pockets of rocks.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are mutually exclusive and contradictory. If Virginia Woolf walked into the river with rocks in her pockets, she could not simultaneously be walking away from the river after emptying her pockets of rocks.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.,Virginia Woolf walked into a river after filling her pockets with rocks.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The Premise states: ""Virginia Woolf filled her pockets with rocks and walked into a river.""
   - This indicates two actions performed by Virginia Woolf: 
     1. She filled her pockets with rocks.
     2. She walked into a river.
   - The use of ""and"" suggests that both actions occurred, but it does not specify the exact sequence of these actions.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The Hypothesis states: ""Virginia Woolf walked into a river after filling her pockets with rocks.""
   - This indicates the same two actions as the Premise:
     1. She filled her pockets with rocks.
     2. She walked into a river.
   - The use of ""after"" specifies the sequence of these actions, indicating that she filled her pockets with rocks first and then walked into the river.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise does not explicitly state the sequence of actions but implies that both actions occurred.
   - The Hypothesis explicitly states the sequence of actions.
   - Since the Premise allows for the possibility that the actions occurred in the sequence described in the Hypothesis (filling pockets with rocks first, then walking into the river), the Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the Hypothesis is consistent with the Premise and does not introduce any new information that contradicts the Premise, the Hypothesis can be considered definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
causative-with-CxN,partial,A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.,Blizzards can be fun for children playing in the snow.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.""
   - This indicates that a blizzard occurred and it was severe enough to cover people with snow.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Blizzards can be fun for children playing in the snow.""
   - This suggests that blizzards have the potential to be enjoyable for children who are playing in the snow.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise describes a specific event where a blizzard covered people with snow, implying a potentially dangerous or severe situation.
   - The hypothesis makes a general statement about the potential enjoyment children might find in blizzards.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be an entailment, the premise must definitively support the hypothesis. However, the premise does not provide any information about children or enjoyment; it only describes a severe blizzard.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis could be true or false regardless of the premise. The premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the general statement about children enjoying blizzards.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the hypothesis to be a contradiction, the premise must directly refute the hypothesis. The premise does not refute the idea that blizzards can be fun for children; it simply describes a severe blizzard without addressing the enjoyment aspect.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
causative-with-CxN,partial,A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.,A blizzard soon took snow away from their bodies.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.""
   - This means that a blizzard caused snow to accumulate on their bodies.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""A blizzard soon took snow away from their bodies.""
   - This means that a blizzard caused snow to be removed from their bodies.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise states that the blizzard caused snow to cover their bodies.
   - The Hypothesis states that the blizzard caused snow to be taken away from their bodies.

4. **Inference Determination:**
   - The actions described in the Premise and the Hypothesis are directly opposite to each other.
   - If a blizzard covers their bodies with snow, it cannot simultaneously take snow away from their bodies.

Given this analysis, the Hypothesis cannot be true if the Premise is true. Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

The correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
causative-with-CxN,partial,A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.,Their bodies were soon covered with snow from the blizzard.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""A blizzard soon covered their bodies with snow.""
   - This statement indicates that a blizzard occurred and as a result, snow covered their bodies.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""Their bodies were soon covered with snow from the blizzard.""
   - This statement indicates that their bodies were covered with snow, and the source of the snow is specified as the blizzard.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe the same event: a blizzard causing snow to cover their bodies.
   - The Hypothesis rephrases the Premise without changing the meaning or introducing any new information.
   - The temporal aspect (""soon"") and the cause (""from the blizzard"") are consistent in both statements.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the Hypothesis is a restatement of the Premise and does not introduce any new information or contradictions, it is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The harder they come, the harder they fall.",They are likely to be injured if they fall hard.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The phrase ""The harder they come, the harder they fall"" is a proverb. It suggests that the more forceful or intense something is, the more significant the consequences will be when it fails or collapses.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states, ""They are likely to be injured if they fall hard."" This implies that a hard fall increases the likelihood of injury.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise does not explicitly mention injury; it only talks about the intensity of the fall being proportional to the intensity of the initial action or state.
   - The hypothesis introduces a new element (injury) that is not directly addressed in the premise.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be definitely true given the premise, the premise would need to explicitly or implicitly suggest that a hard fall results in injury. The premise does not provide this information.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise talks about the intensity of the fall but does not provide information about the consequences (injury). Therefore, the hypothesis is a plausible extension but not a guaranteed outcome.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: The hypothesis would be false if the premise suggested that a hard fall does not result in injury. However, the premise does not contradict the hypothesis; it simply does not address it.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The harder they come, the harder they fall.",How hard they fall is dependent on their actions.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""The harder they come, the harder they fall.""
   - This statement suggests a direct correlation between the intensity or difficulty of a situation (or a person's approach) and the severity of the consequences or failure.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""How hard they fall is dependent on their actions.""
   - This statement suggests that the severity of the consequences or failure is influenced by the actions taken by the individuals.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise implies a cause-and-effect relationship where the ""harder"" approach leads to a ""harder"" fall.
   - The Hypothesis implies that the severity of the fall is influenced by the actions, which can be interpreted as the approach or behavior of the individuals.

4. **Inference Determination:**
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis both discuss the severity of the fall and its dependency on some factor (approach or actions).
   - The Premise does not explicitly state that actions are the determining factor, but it does imply that the approach (which can be considered a type of action) affects the outcome.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is not directly contradicted by the Premise, but it is also not definitively confirmed. The Premise suggests a general principle, while the Hypothesis provides a specific interpretation of that principle.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

comparative-correlative,partial,"The harder they come, the harder they fall.",They will fall softly regardless of how hard they come at me.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - ""The harder they come, the harder they fall.""
   - This statement suggests a direct relationship between the intensity of the approach (""the harder they come"") and the intensity of the fall (""the harder they fall""). It implies that a stronger approach results in a stronger fall.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""They will fall softly regardless of how hard they come at me.""
   - This statement suggests that the fall will always be soft, no matter the intensity of the approach. It implies that the intensity of the approach does not affect the intensity of the fall.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The Premise indicates a correlation between the intensity of the approach and the intensity of the fall.
   - The Hypothesis denies this correlation by stating that the fall will always be soft, regardless of the approach's intensity.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - The Hypothesis directly contradicts the Premise. The Premise states that a harder approach results in a harder fall, while the Hypothesis states that the fall will always be soft, regardless of the approach's intensity.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

comparative-correlative,partial,"The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.",He has a very annoying voice.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.""
   - This indicates that the presence of ""he"" causes increasing misery over time for the speaker.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""He has a very annoying voice.""
   - This suggests that ""he"" possesses a characteristic (an annoying voice) that could potentially cause discomfort or annoyance.

3. **Relation Analysis**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be entailed by the premise, the premise must provide sufficient information to conclude that ""he has a very annoying voice."" The premise only mentions that the speaker becomes more miserable the longer ""he"" is around, but it does not specify the reason for the misery. It could be due to various factors, not necessarily his voice.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise does not provide specific details about why the speaker becomes miserable. It could be due to his voice, his behavior, or other reasons. Therefore, the hypothesis is a possible but not certain explanation.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the hypothesis to be a contradiction, the premise would need to provide information that directly conflicts with the hypothesis. The premise does not provide any information that would make it impossible for ""he"" to have an annoying voice.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate relation is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the final answer is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.","If he is around longer today, I will probably not enjoy myself.",0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.""
   - This statement indicates a direct relationship between the duration of someone's presence and the speaker's level of misery. The longer the person stays, the more miserable the speaker becomes.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""If he is around longer today, I will probably not enjoy myself.""
   - This statement suggests that if the person stays longer today, the speaker is likely to not have a good time.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a negative impact on the speaker's emotional state due to the prolonged presence of the person.
   - The Premise explicitly states that increased duration leads to increased misery.
   - The Hypothesis implies that increased duration will lead to a lack of enjoyment, which is consistent with the idea of increased misery.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The Hypothesis logically follows from the Premise. If the speaker becomes more miserable the longer the person is around, it is reasonable to infer that the speaker will not enjoy themselves if the person stays longer today.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relation is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.",I'm happiest on the days where he is around a lot.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""The longer he is around, the more miserable I will be.""
   - This means that the presence of ""he"" has a negative impact on the speaker's emotional state. Specifically, the longer ""he"" is present, the more the speaker's misery increases.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""I'm happiest on the days where he is around a lot.""
   - This means that the presence of ""he"" has a positive impact on the speaker's emotional state. Specifically, the more ""he"" is present, the happier the speaker becomes.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates a direct correlation between ""he"" being around and the speaker's misery.
   - The hypothesis indicates a direct correlation between ""he"" being around and the speaker's happiness.

4. **Inference**:
   - The premise and the hypothesis present opposite emotional outcomes based on the same condition (the presence of ""he"").
   - According to the premise, more presence of ""he"" leads to increased misery.
   - According to the hypothesis, more presence of ""he"" leads to increased happiness.

Given that the premise and the hypothesis describe mutually exclusive emotional states (misery vs. happiness) under the same condition (presence of ""he""), the hypothesis cannot be true if the premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a **Contradiction**.

Final answer:
2",2,False,False,True,2
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more I studied, the less I understood.",I studied a lot for my recent exams.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more I studied, the less I understood.""
   - This statement suggests a negative correlation between the amount of studying and the level of understanding. It implies that as the speaker increased their study time, their understanding decreased.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I studied a lot for my recent exams.""
   - This statement indicates that the speaker spent a significant amount of time studying for their recent exams.

3. **Comparing the Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The Premise does not provide a direct measure of how much the speaker studied, only that increased studying led to decreased understanding.
   - The Hypothesis states that the speaker studied a lot, but it does not mention the outcome of this studying (whether they understood the material or not).

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the Hypothesis to be definitely true given the Premise, the Premise would need to explicitly state or strongly imply that the speaker studied a lot. The Premise only discusses the relationship between studying and understanding, not the absolute amount of studying.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise. The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the amount of studying. It only discusses the effect of studying on understanding.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the Hypothesis to be false given the Premise, the Premise would need to imply that the speaker did not study a lot. However, the Premise does not make any claims about the total amount of studying, only the relationship between studying and understanding.

Given the analysis, the Premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the Hypothesis. Therefore, the relationship is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more I studied, the less I understood.",I got more confused as I studied.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more I studied, the less I understood.""
   - This statement suggests a negative correlation between studying and understanding. As the amount of studying increases, the level of understanding decreases.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I got more confused as I studied.""
   - This statement suggests that studying led to an increase in confusion.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the Premise and the Hypothesis describe a negative outcome associated with studying.
   - The Premise indicates a decrease in understanding, which can be interpreted as an increase in confusion.
   - The Hypothesis directly states an increase in confusion.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Hypothesis is a rephrasing of the Premise in terms of confusion rather than understanding.
   - Since a decrease in understanding (Premise) logically implies an increase in confusion (Hypothesis), the Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0 – Entailment

The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.",The Hypothesis is definitely true given the Premise.,False,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more I studied, the less I understood.",I felt like my studying helped me really grasp the subject.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more I studied, the less I understood.""
   - This statement suggests that increased studying led to a decrease in understanding. It implies a negative correlation between studying and understanding.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""I felt like my studying helped me really grasp the subject.""
   - This statement suggests that studying was beneficial and led to a better understanding of the subject. It implies a positive outcome from studying.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that studying more resulted in less understanding.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that studying helped in understanding the subject better.

4. **Inference**:
   - The Premise and the Hypothesis present opposite outcomes of studying. The Premise suggests a negative effect of studying on understanding, while the Hypothesis suggests a positive effect.
   - Therefore, the Hypothesis cannot be true given the Premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

comparative-correlative,partial,"It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.",This drug can be harmful for older patients.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.""
   - This suggests that the drug's effectiveness decreases as the patient's age increases. However, it does not provide any information about the drug being harmful; it only mentions reduced effectiveness.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""This drug can be harmful for older patients.""
   - This suggests that the drug might cause harm to older patients, which is a stronger claim than just being less effective.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise talks about reduced effectiveness with age but does not mention harm.
   - The hypothesis introduces the idea of harm, which is not supported or implied by the premise.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - Since the premise does not provide any information about the drug being harmful, we cannot definitively say that the hypothesis is true based on the premise.
   - The hypothesis introduces a new concept (harm) that is not addressed in the premise, making it a neutral statement in relation to the premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.",This drug is best suited for treating patients who are on the younger side.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.""
   - This implies that the drug's effectiveness decreases as the patient's age increases.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""This drug is best suited for treating patients who are on the younger side.""
   - This suggests that the drug is more effective for younger patients.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates a negative correlation between the patient's age and the drug's effectiveness.
   - The hypothesis suggests that the drug is more effective for younger patients, which aligns with the premise's implication.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Given the premise, the hypothesis logically follows because if the drug is less effective for older patients, it would be more effective for younger patients.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the correct inference relation is:

0 – Entailment

So, the final answer is:
0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.",Ideally patients that take this drug are advanced in age.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""It seems the older the patient, the less effective the drug.""
   - This suggests that the drug's effectiveness decreases as the patient's age increases.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Ideally patients that take this drug are advanced in age.""
   - This suggests that the ideal scenario is for older patients to take this drug.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates that the drug is less effective for older patients.
   - The hypothesis suggests that older patients are the ideal candidates for taking the drug.

4. **Inference**:
   - There is a clear contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise implies that the drug is less effective for older patients, which would logically mean that older patients are not the ideal candidates for taking the drug. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

comparative-correlative,partial,"Applied to health care, the longer we wait for it the worse off we are and the longer we put it off the longer it will take to fine tune it.",Waiting longer for healthcare will make it more expensive to implement.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that delaying healthcare has negative consequences.
   - Specifically, it mentions that the longer we wait, the worse the situation becomes.
   - Additionally, it suggests that postponing healthcare will result in a longer time needed to fine-tune it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis claims that waiting longer for healthcare will make it more expensive to implement.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise does not explicitly mention costs or expenses.
   - It focuses on the worsening condition and the increased time required for fine-tuning healthcare if delayed.
   - The hypothesis introduces a new element (cost) that is not directly addressed in the premise.

4. **Inference**:
   - Since the premise does not provide information about the cost implications of delaying healthcare, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the given premise.
   - The hypothesis might be true (as worsening conditions and longer fine-tuning times could imply higher costs), but this is not explicitly stated in the premise.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the final answer is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that delaying healthcare has negative consequences.
   - Specifically, it mentions that the longer we wait for healthcare, the worse the situation becomes.
   - Additionally, it suggests that postponing healthcare will result in a longer time needed to fine-tune it.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis claims that delaying adequate healthcare will not serve the people's best interests.
   - This implies that postponing healthcare is detrimental to the well-being of the people.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates that delaying healthcare leads to worse outcomes and longer adjustment periods.
   - The hypothesis asserts that delaying healthcare is not beneficial for the people.

4. **Inference**:
   - The premise and the hypothesis are essentially conveying the same idea: that delaying healthcare has negative consequences.
   - The hypothesis is a logical conclusion derived from the premise.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis is definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relation is:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states that delaying health care has negative consequences: ""the longer we wait for it the worse off we are.""
   - It also mentions that postponing health care will make it take longer to fine-tune: ""the longer we put it off the longer it will take to fine tune it.""

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis suggests that it is probably best to keep delaying health care reforms: ""It's probably best to keep putting off applying healthcare reforms.""

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise clearly indicates that delaying health care is detrimental and leads to worse outcomes.
   - The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that delaying health care reforms is a good idea.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. The premise argues against delaying health care, while the hypothesis supports it.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

comparative-correlative,partial,"The more bureaucrats run charities, the more people who need them.",Bureaucrats are always greedy.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""The more bureaucrats run charities, the more people who need them.""
   - This suggests a correlation between the involvement of bureaucrats in running charities and an increase in the number of people who need the services of those charities. It implies a negative impact of bureaucrats on the effectiveness of charities.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Bureaucrats are always greedy.""
   - This is a general statement about the nature of bureaucrats, asserting that they are always motivated by greed.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise does not explicitly state that bureaucrats are greedy. It only implies that their involvement in charities leads to more people needing charity services, which could be due to inefficiency, mismanagement, or other reasons not necessarily related to greed.
   - The hypothesis makes a strong, absolute claim about the character of bureaucrats, which is not directly supported or refuted by the premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - Since the premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the hypothesis, the relationship between the two statements is not one of entailment or contradiction.
   - The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise, as the premise does not address the specific characteristic of greed.

Therefore, the appropriate inference relation is:

comparative-correlative,partial,"The more bureaucrats run charities, the more people who need them.",Bureaucrats are always greedy.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""The more bureaucrats run charities, the more people who need them.""
   - This suggests a correlation between the involvement of bureaucrats in running charities and an increase in the number of people who need those charities. It implies that bureaucratic management might be inefficient or counterproductive, leading to a greater need for charity services.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Bureaucrats are always greedy.""
   - This is a general statement about the nature of bureaucrats, claiming that they are inherently greedy.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise does not directly address the personal characteristics of bureaucrats, such as greed. Instead, it focuses on the outcome of their involvement in running charities.
   - The hypothesis makes a broad generalization about bureaucrats' greed, which is not explicitly mentioned or implied in the premise.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - **Entailment (0)**: For the hypothesis to be an entailment, the premise must provide sufficient information to conclude that bureaucrats are always greedy. The premise does not provide this information.
   - **Neutral (1)**: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the hypothesis about bureaucrats' greed.
   - **Contradiction (2)**: For the hypothesis to be a contradiction, the premise must provide information that directly opposes the idea that bureaucrats are always greedy. The premise does not do this either.

   - This statement suggests a correlation between the number of bureaucrats running charities and the number of people who need the services of those charities. It implies that an increase in bureaucratic involvement in charities leads to an increase in the number of people needing charity services.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - ""Bureaucrats are always greedy.""
   - This statement makes a general claim about the nature of bureaucrats, asserting that they are always greedy.

3. **Comparing Premise and Hypothesis:**
   - The Premise does not make any direct claims about the personal characteristics or motivations of bureaucrats, such as greed. It only discusses the effect of bureaucratic involvement on the number of people needing charity services.
   - The Hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a broad and absolute statement about bureaucrats being greedy.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - **Entailment (0):** For the Hypothesis to be entailed by the Premise, the Premise would need to provide information that directly supports the claim that bureaucrats are always greedy. The Premise does not provide such information.
   - **Neutral (1):** The Premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the claim that bureaucrats are always greedy. The relationship between bureaucratic involvement and the number of people needing charity services does not inherently speak to the personal characteristics of bureaucrats.

comparative-correlative,partial,"The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.",Senior management is always micromanaging our decisions.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.""
   - This implies that senior management's involvement is proportional to the cost of the decision. Higher costs lead to more involvement from senior management.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Senior management is always micromanaging our decisions.""
   - This implies that senior management is involved in all decisions, regardless of their cost, and is involved in a detailed, hands-on manner (micromanaging).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise suggests a conditional involvement of senior management based on the cost of decisions. It does not imply that senior management is involved in all decisions, nor does it suggest the level of detail (micromanaging) in their involvement.
   - The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests constant and detailed involvement from senior management in all decisions.

4. **Inference**:
   - The hypothesis extends beyond what the premise states. The premise does not support the idea that senior management is involved in all decisions or that they micromanage. It only states that their involvement increases with the cost of the decision.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be definitively concluded from the premise. It is possible that senior management is not involved in less expensive decisions, which contradicts the hypothesis's claim of ""always micromanaging.""

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is best described as a **Contradiction**.

comparative-correlative,partial,"The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.",Senior management likes to oversee decisions that are most likely to cost a lot of money.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - The premise states that ""The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.""
   - This means that as the cost of a decision increases, the involvement of senior management also increases.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - The hypothesis states that ""Senior management likes to oversee decisions that are most likely to cost a lot of money.""
   - This suggests that senior management has a preference for overseeing decisions that are expected to be expensive.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The premise provides a conditional relationship between the cost of a decision and the involvement of senior management.
   - The hypothesis implies a preference or tendency of senior management to oversee expensive decisions.

4. **Inference Determination:**
   - The premise does not explicitly state that senior management ""likes"" to oversee expensive decisions; it only states that they are more involved as the cost increases.
   - The hypothesis introduces the idea of ""liking"" or preference, which is not directly supported by the premise.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise. The premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or deny the hypothesis.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.",Senior management doesn't care much about the cost of potential decisions.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""The more expensive the decision, the more will senior management be involved.""
   - This implies that senior management's involvement increases with the cost of the decision. In other words, senior management is more likely to be involved in decisions that have higher costs.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""Senior management doesn't care much about the cost of potential decisions.""
   - This implies that senior management is indifferent to the cost of decisions, suggesting that their involvement is not influenced by the cost.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates a direct relationship between the cost of decisions and senior management's involvement (higher cost leads to more involvement).
   - The hypothesis suggests the opposite, that senior management's involvement is not influenced by the cost of decisions.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - If senior management is more involved in more expensive decisions (as per the premise), it directly contradicts the idea that they don't care much about the cost of potential decisions (as per the hypothesis).
   - Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be true if the premise is true.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

comparative-correlative,partial,"Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.",The game will be fun.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.""
   - This implies that there is an activity that needs to be completed before continuing with the game.
   - The focus is on the speed of completing the current task to proceed with the game.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""The game will be fun.""
   - This is a statement about the nature or quality of the game, specifically that it will be enjoyable.

3. **Relation Analysis**:
   - The premise does not provide any information about the nature or quality of the game. It only discusses the sequence of events (completing a task to proceed with the game).
   - There is no direct or implied information in the premise that indicates whether the game will be fun or not.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the premise does not provide any information that would make the hypothesis definitely true or definitely false, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral.

Therefore, the correct relation is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.",We have to do this before the game can start.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze both statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""Now then, the faster that we can do this, the faster we can get on with the game.""
   - This implies that ""doing this"" is a prerequisite for continuing with the game. The phrase ""the faster we can get on with the game"" suggests that the game is already in progress or about to start, and ""doing this"" is a necessary step to proceed further.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""We have to do this before the game can start.""
   - This implies that ""doing this"" is a prerequisite for the game to begin.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise suggests that ""doing this"" is necessary to continue with the game, but it does not explicitly state that the game has not started yet. It only implies that the game cannot proceed further without ""doing this.""
   - The hypothesis explicitly states that ""doing this"" is required before the game can start, which is a stronger claim than what the premise provides.

4. **Inference Relation**:
   - The hypothesis makes a specific claim about the sequence of events (i.e., ""doing this"" must happen before the game starts), while the premise only indicates that ""doing this"" is necessary to continue with the game.
   - The premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the game has not started yet, only that it cannot proceed without ""doing this.""

Given this analysis, the hypothesis may or may not be true based on the information provided in the premise. The premise does not contradict the hypothesis, but it also does not fully support it.

   - This implies that there is a task (""this"") that needs to be completed before continuing with the game. The emphasis is on completing the task quickly to proceed with the game.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis:**
   - The hypothesis states: ""We don't have to do this before the game starts.""
   - This suggests that the task mentioned in the premise is not a prerequisite for starting the game.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The premise implies that the task must be done to proceed with the game, indicating a sequence where the task comes before the game.
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that the task does not need to be done before the game starts.

4. **Inference Relation:**
   - Since the hypothesis contradicts the sequence implied by the premise, it cannot be true if the premise is true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Answer: 2",Answer: 2,False,False,True,2
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.",More snow makes skiers go faster down the slopes.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.""
   - This suggests that an increase in snow leads to a decrease in danger for skiers. It implies a relationship between the amount of snow and the level of danger, but it does not provide specific details about the speed of skiers.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""More snow makes skiers go faster down the slopes.""
   - This suggests that an increase in snow leads to an increase in the speed of skiers. It implies a relationship between the amount of snow and the speed of skiers.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise talks about the relationship between snow and danger, while the hypothesis talks about the relationship between snow and speed.
   - There is no direct information in the premise about how snow affects the speed of skiers. The premise only discusses the effect of snow on danger, not on speed.

4. **Inference**:
   - Since the premise does not provide any information about the speed of skiers, we cannot definitively conclude whether the hypothesis is true or false based on the premise alone.
   - The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise, as the premise does not address the speed of skiers.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral: The Hypothesis may or may not be true given the Premise.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

1",1,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.",It's most safe to ski if there has been a substantial snowfall recently.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.""
   - This implies that an increase in snowfall correlates with a decrease in danger for skiers.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""It's most safe to ski if there has been a substantial snowfall recently.""
   - This suggests that substantial snowfall makes skiing the safest.

3. **Comparing Premise and Hypothesis**:
   - The premise indicates a direct relationship between more snow and less danger.
   - The hypothesis takes this a step further by asserting that substantial snowfall results in the highest level of safety for skiing.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - The hypothesis logically follows from the premise. If more snow leads to less danger, then substantial snowfall (which implies a significant amount of snow) would indeed make skiing safer.
   - There is no information in the premise that contradicts the hypothesis.
   - The hypothesis is a reasonable extension of the premise and can be considered definitely true given the premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.",It is too dangerous to ski on days when there was heavy snow recently.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - ""The more snow, the less danger there is to skiers.""
   - This statement suggests that an increase in snow leads to a decrease in danger for skiers. In other words, heavy snow is associated with safer skiing conditions.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - ""It is too dangerous to ski on days when there was heavy snow recently.""
   - This statement suggests that heavy snow makes skiing conditions too dangerous.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Premise indicates that heavy snow reduces danger for skiers.
   - The Hypothesis indicates that heavy snow increases danger for skiers.

4. **Inference**:
   - The two statements are directly contradictory. The Premise claims that more snow makes skiing safer, while the Hypothesis claims that more snow makes skiing more dangerous.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more they work, the more I will pay them.",My workers always work very hard.,1,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""The more they work, the more I will pay them.""
   - This implies a conditional relationship between the amount of work done and the payment received. It suggests that payment is proportional to the amount of work, but it does not provide any information about the actual amount of work being done.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""My workers always work very hard.""
   - This statement asserts that the workers consistently put in a lot of effort.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise does not provide any information about the actual work habits of the workers. It only describes a payment policy based on the amount of work done.
   - The hypothesis makes a specific claim about the workers' behavior, which is not addressed or implied by the premise.

4. **Inference**:
   - Since the premise does not provide any information about how hard the workers actually work, we cannot definitively conclude that the workers always work very hard based on the premise alone.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise.

Based on this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is:

1 – Neutral",1 – Neutral,False,True,False,1
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more they work, the more I will pay them.",I intend to compensate my workers based on their amount of work.,0,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""The more they work, the more I will pay them.""
   - This implies a direct relationship between the amount of work done and the payment received. Specifically, it suggests that payment increases with the amount of work.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""I intend to compensate my workers based on their amount of work.""
   - This implies that the speaker plans to determine compensation based on the quantity of work performed by the workers.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both the premise and the hypothesis describe a relationship between work and compensation.
   - The premise explicitly states that payment increases with more work, which aligns with the hypothesis's intention to compensate based on the amount of work.

4. **Inference Determination**:
   - Given the premise, the hypothesis is definitely true because the premise directly supports the idea that compensation is based on the amount of work.
   - There is no information in the premise that contradicts the hypothesis, nor is there any ambiguity that would make the hypothesis only possibly true.

Therefore, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is one of **Entailment**.

The numerical value corresponding to Entailment is **0**.

Final answer:
0",0,True,False,False,0
comparative-correlative,partial,"The more they work, the more I will pay them.",I never pay my workers.,2,"To determine the inference relation between the Premise and the Hypothesis, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - The premise states: ""The more they work, the more I will pay them.""
   - This implies that there is a conditional relationship between the amount of work done and the payment. Specifically, it suggests that payment is given and increases with the amount of work.

2. **Hypothesis Analysis**:
   - The hypothesis states: ""I never pay my workers.""
   - This implies that under no circumstances do the workers receive payment.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The premise indicates that payment is given based on the amount of work done.
   - The hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that no payment is ever given.

4. **Inference**:
   - Since the hypothesis states that workers are never paid, it directly contradicts the premise, which states that workers are paid based on their work.

Given this analysis, the relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis is a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct numerical value is:

2",2,False,False,True,2
